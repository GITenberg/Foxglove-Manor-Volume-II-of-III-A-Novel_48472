      CHAPTER XIV. BAPTISTO STAYS AT HOME.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s Haldane sat in
      his study, the evening previous to the morning fixed for his journey to
      London, Baptisto entered quickly and stood before the desk at which his
      master was busily writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I speak to you, senor?" Haldane looked and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Baptisto?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have arranged that I shall go with you to-morrow, but I have had
      during the last few days an attack of my old vertigo. Can you possibly
      dispense with my attendance, senor?" Haldane stared in surprise at the
      Spaniards face, which was inscrutable as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say you wish to remain at home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, senor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? because you are ill? On the contrary, you look in excellent health.
      No; it is impossible. I cannot get along without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Haldane returned to his papers as if the matter was ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptisto, however, did not budge, but remained in the same position, with
      his dark eyes fixed upon his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do me this favour, senor. I am really indisposed, and must beg to
      remain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane laughed, for an idea suddenly occurred to him which seemed to
      explain the mystery of his servant's request.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good Baptisto, I think I understand the cause of your complaint, and I
      am sure a little travel will do you good. It is that dark-eyed widow of
      the lodge-keeper who attaches you so much to the Manor. The warm blood of
      Spain still burns in your veins, and, despite your sad experience of
      women, you are still impressionable. Eh? am I right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptisto quickly shook his head, with the least suspicion of a smile upon
      his swarthy face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not impressionable, senor, and I do not admire your English women;
      but I wish to remain all the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! In serious lament, senor, I beseech you to allow me to remain."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Haldane was not to be persuaded at what he conceived to be a mere whim
      of his servant. He still believed that Baptisto had fallen a captive to
      the charms of Mrs. Feme, a little plump, dark-eyed woman, with a large
      family. He had frequently of late seen the Spaniard hanging about the
      lodge&mdash;on one occasion nursing and dandling the youngest child&mdash;and
      he had smiled to himself, thinking that the poor fellow's misanthropy, or
      rather his misogynism, was in a fair way of coming to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding his master indisposed to take his request seriously, Baptisto
      retired; and presently Haldane strolled into the drawing-room, where he
      found his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you heard of the last freak of Baptisto? He actually wants to remain
      at ease, instead of accompanying me in my journey."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen looked up from some embroidery, in which she was busily engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On no account!" she exclaimed. "If you don't take him with you, I. shall
      not stay in the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me! said the philosopher. Surely you are not afraid of poor
      Baptisto!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not afraid of him exactly, but he makes me shiver. He comes and goes like
      a ghost, and when you least expect him, he is at your elbow. Then, of
      course, I cannot help remembering he has committed a murder!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the kind," said Haldane, laughing and throwing himself into a
      chair. "My dear Ellen, you don't believe the whole truth of that affair.
      True, he surprised that Spanish wife of his with her gallant, whom he
      stabbed; but I have it on excellent authority that it was a kind of
      duello; the other man was armed, and so it was a fair fight." Ellen
      shuddered, and showed more nervous agitation than her husband could quite
      account for.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take him away with you," she cried; "take him away. If you never bring
      him back, I shall rejoice. If I had been consulted, he would never have
      been brought to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later in the evening, when Haldane had returned to his papers,
      which he was diligently finishing to take away with him, he rang and
      summoned the Spaniard to his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is all settled. I have consulted your mistress, and she insists
      in your accompanying me to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp flash came upon Baptisto's dark eyes. He made an angry gesture;
      then controlling himself, he said in a low, emphatic voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The <i>senora</i> means it? <i>She</i> does not wish me to remain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I ask why?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only because she does not want you, and I do. Between ourselves, she is
      not quite so certain of you as I am. She has never forgotten that little
      affair in Spain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the dark eyes flashed, and again there was the same angry gesture,
      instantly checked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are violent sometimes, my Baptisto, and madame is a little afraid of
      you. When she knows you better, as I know you, she will be aware that you
      are rational; at present&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At present, senor," said Baptisto, "she would rather not have me so near.
      Ah, I can understand! Perhaps she has reason to be afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the man's manner, which was sinister and almost threatening,
      jarred upon his master's mind. Rising from his chair, Haldane stood with
      his back to the fire, and, with a frown, regarded the Spaniard, as, he
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, Baptisto. I have noticed with great annoyance, especially
      of late, that your manner to madame has been strange, not to say sullen.
      You are whimsical still, and apt to take offence. If this goes on, if you
      fail in respect to your mistress, and make your presence uncomfortable in
      this house, we shall have to part."
    </p>
    <p>
      To Haldane's astonishment, Baptisto asked an explanation, and, falling on
      his knees, seized his master's hand and kissed it eagerly, "Senor! Senor!
      you don't comprehend. You don't think I am ungrateful, that I do not
      remember? But you are wrong. I would die to save you&mdash;yes, I would
      die; and I would kill with my own hand any one who did you an injury. I am
      your servant, your slave&mdash;ah yes, till death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, get up, and go and finish packing my things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, senor&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get up, I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Spaniard rose, and with folded hands and bent head stood waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get ready like a sensible fellow, and let us have no more of this
      foolery. There, there, I understand. You are exciting yourself for
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, I am to go, senor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning Baptisto entered the carriage with his master, and
      was driven to the railway station, some seven miles away. As they went
      along, Haldane noticed that the man looked very ill, and that from time to
      time he put his hand to his head as if in pain. At the railway station,
      while they were waiting for the train, matters looked most serious.
      Suddenly the Spaniard fell forward on the platform as if in strong
      convulsions, his eyes starting out of his head, his mouth foaming. They
      sprinkled water on his face, chafed his hands, and with some difficulty
      brought him round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil!" muttered Haldane to himself. "It looks like epilepsy!"
      Baptisto was placed on a seat, and lay back ghastly pale, as if utterly
      exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you better now?" asked Haldane, bending over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little better, senor."
    </p>
    <p>
      But seeing him so utterly helpless, and likely to have other seizure,
      Haldane rapidly calculated in his own mind the inexpediency of taking him
      away on a long railway journey. After all, the poor fellow had not
      exaggerated his condition, when he had pleaded illness as an excuse for
      remaining at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," said Haldane, "I think you will have to remain behind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptisto opened his eyes feebly, and stretched out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, senor; since you wish it, I will go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall remain," answered Haldane, just as the whistle of the coming
      train was heard in the distance. "Perhaps, if you are better in a day or
      two, you can follow; but you will go away now in the carriage, and send
      over to Dr. Spruce, and he will prescribe for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptisto did not answer, but, taking his masters hand, kissed it
      gratefully. The train came up. Haldane entered a carriage, and, gazing
      from the window as the train began to move on, saw Baptisto still seated
      on the platform, very pale, his eyes half closed, his head recumbent. Near
      him stood the station master, a railway porter, and the groom who had
      driven them over from the Manor, all regarding him with languid curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the moment the train was gone, Baptisto began to recover. Rising to
      his feet, and refusing all offers of assistance from the others, he
      strolled out of the station, and quietly mounted the dog-cart. The groom
      got up beside him, and they drove homeward through the green lanes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Baptisto was a gentleman, and seldom entered or tolerated familiarity
      from his fellow-servants. Had it been otherwise, the groom might have
      asked the explanation of his curious conduct; for no sooner was he mounted
      on the dogcart, and driving along in the fresh air, than the Spaniard
      seemed to forget all about his recent illness, sat erect like a man in
      perfect health, and exhibited none of the curious symptoms which had so
      alarmed his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the groom, who was a thirsty individual, suggested that they
      should make a detour and call at the Blue Boar Inn for a little stimulant,
      chiefly as a corrective to the attack from which his companion had just
      suffered, the Spaniard turned his dark eyes round about him and actually
      winked. This proceeding so startled the groom that he almost dropped the
      reins, for never in the whole course of his sojourn had the foreign gent
      condescended to such a familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      They drove round to the Blue Boar, however, and the groom consumed the
      brandy, while Baptisto, who was a teetotaller, had some lemonade, and lit
      his cigar. Then they drove home to the Manor, Baptisto sitting with folded
      arms, completely and absolutely recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon that day, as Mrs. Haldane moved about the conservatory, looking
      after her roses, a servant announced the Rev. Mr. Santley. Ellen flushed,
      a little startled at the announcement, coming so soon after her husband's
      departure, and her first impulse was to deny herself; but before she could
      do so the clergyman himself appeared at the door of the conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are an early visitor," she said coldly, bending her face over the
      flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is just noon," answered the clergyman, "and I was going home from a
      sick-call. Has Mr. Haldane gone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Did you wish to see him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not particularly, though I had a little commission which I might have
      asked him to execute had I been in time." Surely the man's fall had
      already begun. Ellen knew perfectly well that he was lying. In point of
      fact, he had seen the dog-cart drive past on the way to the station, and
      he had been unable to resist the temptation of coming over without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      With face half averted, Ellen led the way into the drawing-room, and on to
      the terrace beyond, from which there was a pleasant view of the Manor, the
      plain, and the surrounding country. Just below the gardens were laid out
      in flowerbeds and gravel walks; but the dark shrubberies were beyond, and
      at a little distance, well in the shadow of the trees, the old chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Ellen stood silent, gazing upon the woods and
      lawn, while the clergyman stood just behind her, evidently regarding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she could bear it no longer, but, turning quickly, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you come? Have you anything to say to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, Ellen, if you are angry," replied the clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Angry! You surely know best if I have cause. After what has passed, I
      think it is better that we should not meet," she added in a low voice. "At
      least, not often."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw she was agitated, and he took a certain pleasure in her agitation,
      for it showed him that she was not quite unsusceptible to the influence he
      might bring to bear upon her. As he stood there, his sad eyes fixed upon
      her, his being conscious of every movement she made, of every breath she
      drew, he felt again the deep fatality of his passion, and silently yielded
      to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another long pause, which he was the first to break.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, Ellen, I sometimes tremble for you, when I think of your
      husbands opinions. In time you may learn to share them, and then we should
      be further apart than ever. At present, it is my sole comfort to know you
      possess that living faith without which every soul is lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lost?" she repeated, in a bewildering way, not looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean in the vulgar sense; the theological ideas of damnation have
      never had my sanction, far less my sympathy. But materialism degrades the
      believer, and sooner or later comes a disbelief in all that is holy,
      beautiful, and sanctified. It is a humble creed, the new creed of science,
      and fatal to spiritual hopes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it matter so much what one believes, if one's life is good?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It matters so much that I would rather see one I loved dead before my
      feet than an avowed unbeliever. But there, I have not come to preach to
      you. When does Mr. Haldane return?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I told you: in a fortnight, perhaps sooner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And during his absence we shall meet again, I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated and looked at him. His eyes were fixed on the distant woods,
      though he stood expectantly, as if awaiting her reply, which did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you not trust me?" he exclaimed. "You know I am your friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so; but I think it is best that you should not come here. If you
      were married, it would be different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not marry," he replied impatiently. "What then? I am a priest of
      God, and you may trust me fully. If our Church commenced the confessional,
      you might enter it without fear, and I&mdash;I would listen to the
      outpourings of your heart. Should you in your grief be afraid to utter
      them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved away from him, turning her back; but betrayed herself. He saw
      the bright colour mount to her neck and mantle there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What nonsense you talk!" she said presently, with a forced laugh. "Are
      you going over to Rome?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might go over to the evil place itself, Ellen, if <i>you</i> were
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking the words, the tone, in their diabolic gentleness,
      their suavity of supreme and total self-surrender. She felt helpless in
      spite of herself. The man was overmastering her, and rapidly encroaching.
      She felt like a person morally stifled, and with a strong effort tried to
      shake the evil influence away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was right," she said. "We must not meet."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please. I will come, or I will go, at your will. You have only to
      say to me, 'Go and destroy yourself, obliterate yourself for ever from my
      life, blot yourself out from the roll of living beings,' and I shall obey
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her spirit revolted more and more against the steadfast, self-assured
      obliquity of the man. She saw that he was desperate, and that the danger
      grew with his desperation. In every word he spoke, and in his whole
      manner, there was the sombre assurance of something between them, of some
      veiled, but excitable sympathy, which she herself utterly ignored. That
      moment of wild delirium, when he caught her in his arms and kissed her,
      seemed, instead of severing them, to have made a link between them. He had
      been conscious of her indignation, he had even professed penitence; but
      she saw to her dismay that the fact of his folly filled him, not with
      fear, but with courage. So she determined to end it once and for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us understand each other," she said, trembling violently. "How dare
      you talk as if there was any community of feeling between us? How dare you
      presume upon my patience, Mr. Santley? It is wretched; it is abominable!
      When you talk of killing yourself, when you assume that I have any serious
      interest in you, or any right over you, you insult me and degrade
      yourself. We are nothing, and can be nothing to each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that," he replied. "Do you think I am so mad as not to know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why do you come here to torture me, and to tempt me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The word came from her before she knew it, and her face became scarlet;
      but he uttered no protest, and raised his white hand in deprecation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tempt you? God forbid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not mean that," she murmured, in confusion; "but you must know, you
      cannot fail to know, that it is not right for a married woman to receive
      such expressions of sympathy, however spiritual. It is that which makes me
      hate the Catholic Church. The priest promises you his office, and too
      often makes mischief under the guise of religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you accuse me of doing so?" he demanded, in the same sad, calm voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but you should remember that you have not the custody of my soul, and
      I have no right to influence your actions. Come," she continued, with
      rather a forced laugh, "talk to me like a true English clergyman. Tell me
      of the old women of the village, and their ailments; ask me for a
      subscription to give to your new soup kitchen; talk to me as if Mr.
      Haldane were listening to us&mdash;of your schools, your parish troubles&mdash;and
      you shall find me an eager listener!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will talk of anything, Ellen, so long as I may talk to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again that manner of despairing certainty, of assured and fatal sympathy.
      The man was incorrigible.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited impatiently for some minutes, but finding he did not speak
      again, she held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you have nothing more to tell me," she observed lightly, "I think I
      will say good morning. I am going to order the carriage and drive to
      Omberley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When may I come again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you have anything really parochial to say to me. Please go now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met, and hers sank beneath his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he crossed towards the door it opened, and Baptisto appeared upon the
      threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ring, senora?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of the Spaniard's dull impressive face Mrs. Haldane started
      violently, and went a little pale. She had heard nothing of his return,
      and he came like an apparition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baptisto! What are you doing here? I thought&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused in wonder, while the Spaniard inclined his head and bowed
      profoundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was taken with a vertigo at the station, and the senor permitted me to
      return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then your master has gone alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, senora."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Order the carriage at once. I am going out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptisto bowed and retired, quickly closing the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Santley, who had stood listening during the above conversation, now
      prepared to follow, but, glancing at Ellen, saw that she was unusually
      agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a sinister-looking fellow," he remarked. "I am afraid he has
      frightened you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, no," she replied; "though I confess I was startled at his
      unexpected return. Good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye," he said, again taking her hand and holding it up a moment in
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing from the drawing-room, he again came face to face with Baptisto,
      who was lurking in the lobby, but who drew aside with a respectful bow, to
      allow the clergyman to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the hall, descended the stone steps of the portico, and walked
      slowly towards the lodge. As he passed the ruined chapel, its shadows
      seemed to fall upon his spirit and leave it in ominous darkness. He
      shivered slightly, and drew his cloak about him, then with his eyes cast
      down he thoughtfully walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not glance back. Had he done so, he would have seen Baptisto
      standing on the steps of the Manor house, watching him with a sinister
      smile.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV. CONJURATION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was a chill day
      in early autumn, and as Charles Santley passed along the dark avenue of
      the Manor his path was strewn here and there with freshly fallen leaves.
      Dark shadows lay on every side, and the heaven above was full of a sullen,
      cheerless light. It was just the day for a modern Faust, in the course of
      his noonday walk, to encounter, in some fancied guise, canine or human,
      the evil one of old superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it may, Santley knew at last that the hour of his temptation
      was over, and that the evil one was not far away. He knew it, by the
      sullen acquiescence of evil of his own soul; by the deliberate and
      despairing precision with which he had chosen the easy and downward path;
      by the sense of darkness which already obliterated the bright moral
      instincts in his essentially religious mind. He had spoken the truth when
      he said he would follow Ellen Haldane anywhere, even to the eternal pit
      itself. Her beauty possessed him and disturbed him with the joy of impure
      thoughts; and now that he perceived his own power to trouble her peace of
      mind, he rejoiced at the strength of his passion with a truly diabolic
      perversity.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he came out of the lodge gate he saw, far away over the fields, the
      spire of his own church.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man's faith in spiritual things, so far from being shaken, was as
      strong as ever. His own sense of moral deterioration, of spiritual
      backsliding, only made him believe all the more fervently in the heaven
      from which he had fallen, or might choose to fall. For it is surely a
      mistake to picture, as so many poets have pictured, the evil spirit as one
      ignorant of or insensible to good. Far wiser is the theology which
      describes Satan as the highest of angelic spirits&mdash;the spirit which,
      above all others, had beheld and contemplated the Godhead, and had then,
      in sheer revolt and negation, deliberately and advisedly decided its own
      knowledge and rejected its own truthright. Santley was, in his basest
      moods, essentially a godly man&mdash;a man strangely curious of the beauty
      of goodness, and capable of infinite celestial dreams. If, like many
      another, he confused the flesh and the spirit, he did no more than many
      sons of Eve have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked slowly along he mused, somewhat to this effect&mdash;"I love
      this woman. In her heart she loves me. Her superior spiritual endowments
      are mystically alive to those I myself possess. Her husband is a clod, an
      unbeliever, with no spiritual promptings. In his sardonic presence, her
      aspirations are chilled, frozen at the very fountain-head; whereas, in
      mine, all the sweetness and the power of her nature are aroused, though
      with a certain irritation. If I persist, she must yield to the slow moral
      mesmerism of my passion, and eventually fall. Is this necessarily evil? Am
      I of set purpose sinning? Is it not possible that even a breach of the
      moral law might, under certain conditions, lead us both to a higher
      religious place&mdash;yes, even to a deeper and intenser consciousness of
      God?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And again&mdash;"What <i>is</i> sin? Surely it is better than moral
      stagnation, which is death. There are certain deflections from duty which,
      like the side stroke of a bird's wing, may waft us higher. In the arms of
      this woman, I should surely be nearer God than crawling alone on the bare
      path of duty, loving nothing, hoping nothing, becoming nothing. What is it
      that Goethe says of the Eternal Feminine which lead us ever upward and
      onward? Which was the highest, Faust before he loved Marguerite, or Faust
      after he passed out of the shadow of his sin into the sphere of imperial
      and daring passion? I believe in God, I love this woman. Out of that
      belief, and that love, shall I not become a living soul?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this the man's own musing, or rather the very devil whispering in his
      ear? From such fragmentary glimpses of his mind as have been given, we can
      at least guess the extent of his intellectual degradation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked along the country road, his pale countenance became seraphic;
      just so may the face of Lucifer have looked when he plumed his wings for
      deliberate flight from heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into a roadside farm and had a glass of milk, which the good
      woman of the place handed to him with a sentiment of adoration; he looked
      so gentle, so at peace with all living things. His white hand rested for a
      moment on the head of her little girl, in gentle benediction. He had never
      felt more tenderly disposed to all creation than at that moment, when he
      was prepared to dip a pen into his own hearts blood, and sign the little
      promissory note which Mephistopheles carries, always ready, in his pocket.
      He had hated his congregation before; now he loved them exceedingly&mdash;and
      all the world.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI. AT THE OPERA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n arriving in
      London, George Haldane was driven straight to the house of an old friend
      at Chelsea, where he always stayed during his visits to the Metropolis.
      This friend was Lovell Blakiston, as eccentric a being in his own way as
      Haldane himself was in his. He had been, since boyhood, in the India
      Office, where he still put in an appearance several hours a day, and
      whence he still drew a large income, with the immediate right to a
      retiring pension whenever he choose to take it. He was a great student,
      especially of the pagan poets and philosophers; and the greater part of
      his days and nights were spent in his-old-fashioned library, opening with
      folding doors on to a quiet lawn, which led in its turn to the very
      river-side. He had two pet aversions&mdash;modern progress, in the shape
      of railroads, electricity, geology; all the new business of science and
      modern religion, especially in its connection with Christian theology. He
      was, in short, a pagan pure and simple, fond of old books, old wine, old
      meditations, and old gods. However he might differ with Haldane on such
      subjects' as the nebular hypothesis, which he hated with all his heart, he
      agreed with him sufficiently on the subject of Christianity. Both had a
      cordial dislike for church ceremonies and church bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two gentlemen had another taste in common. This was the opera, which
      both enjoyed hugely, though Blakiston never ceased to regret the
      disappearance of that old operatic institution, the ballet, which, like a
      rich dessert wine, used to bring the feast of music to a delightfully
      sensuous conclusion. Haldane was too young a man to remember such visions
      of loveliness as Cerito, whom his old friend had often gone to see in
      company with Horne Took.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it happened that two or three days after his arrival, Haldane
      accompanied his host to the opera house, where Patti was to appear in
      "Traviata."
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated comfortably in the stalls, he was glancing quietly round the house
      between the acts, when his attention was attracted to a face in one of the
      private boxes. A pale, Madonna-like, yet girlish face, set in golden hair,
      with soft blue eyes, and an expression so forlorn, so wistful, so ill at
      ease, that it was almost painful to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane started in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter?" said his friend; "Have you recognized anybody?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not certain," returned Haldane, raising his opera-glass and
      surveying the face through them. Then, after a long look, he added' as if
      to himself, "I am almost sure it is the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean that young lady in black, seated in the second tier?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Oblige me by looking at her, and tell me what you think of her."
      Blakiston raised his opera-glass, and took a long look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" asked Haldane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She reminds me of one of your detestable pre-Raphaelistic drawings,
      shockheaded and vacuous. She is pretty, I grant you, but she has no
      expression."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say, on the contrary, a very marked expression of deep pain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tight lacing," grunted Blakiston. "Your modern women have no shape, since
      Cerito."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Haldane rose from his seat. Looking up again, he had met the young
      lady's eyes, and had perceived at once that she recognized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to speak to her," he explained. "She is a neighbour of ours,
      and a friend of my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his way to the second tier, and finding the door of the box open,
      he looked in, and saw the person he sought, seated in company with an
      elderly lady and a young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Dove!" he said, advancing into the box. "Although we have only met
      twice, I thought I could not be mistaken." Edith (for it was she) turned
      quickly and took his outstretched hand..
    </p>
    <p>
      "How strange to find you here!" she exclaimed. "Is Mrs. Haldane with you?
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed. I left her to the pious duties of the parish, which she is
      fulfilling daily, I expect, in company with your seraphic friend the
      minister."
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith looked at him with strange surprise, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When did you come to town?" he asked. "I thought you were quite a country
      young lady, and never ventured into the giddy world of London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not very well," replied Edith, "and my aunt invited me to stop with
      her a few weeks. This is my aunt, Mrs. Hetherington; and this gentleman is
      my cousin Walter." Here Edith went somewhat nervously through the ceremony
      of introduction. She added, with a slight flush, "My cousin insisted on
      bringing us here to-night. I did not wish to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" demanded Haldane, noticing her uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I did not think it right; and I have been thinking all the
      evening what the vicar will say when I tell him I have been to such a
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the old lady shook her head ominously, and gave a slight groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the place so terrible," asked Haldane, smiling, "now you have seen
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is very pretty; and of course the singing is beautiful. But Mr.
      Santley does not approve of the theatre, and I am sorry I came."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, Edith," said young Hetherington, with a laugh. "You know you
      wanted to see the 'Traviata,' The fact is," he continued, turning to
      Haldane, "my mother and my cousin are both terribly old-fashioned. My
      mother here is Scotch, and believes in the kirk, the whole kirk, and
      nothing but the kirk; and as for Edith, she is entirely, as they say in
      Scotland, under the minister's 'thoomb.' I thought they would have enjoyed
      themselves, but they have been doing penance all the evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without paying attention to her cousin's remarks, Edith was looking
      thoughtfully at Haldane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When do you return to Omberley?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sure&mdash;in a fortnight, at the latest. I am going on to
      France."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Mrs. Haldane will remain all that time alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," he replied. "Oh, she will not miss me. She has her household
      duties, her parish, her garden&mdash;to say nothing of her clergyman. And
      you, do <i>you</i> stay long in London?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sure; I think not. I am tired of it already."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again that weary, wistful look, which sat so strangely on the young,
      almost childish face. She sighed, and gazed sadly around the crowded
      house. A minute later, Haldane took his leave, and rejoined his friend in
      the stalls. Looking up at the end of the next act, he saw that the box was
      empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women had yielded to their consciences, and departed before the end of
      the performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, when Haldane went home to Chelsea, he found a letter from his
      wife. It was a long letter, but contained no news whatever, being chiefly
      occupied with self-reproaches that the writer had not accompanied her
      husband in his pilgrimage. This struck Haldane as rather peculiar, as in
      former communications Ellen had expressed no such dissatisfaction; but he
      was by nature and of set habit unsuspicious, and he set it down to some
      momentary <i>ennui</i>. The letter contained no mention whatever of Mr.
      Santley, but in the postscript, where ladies often put the most
      interesting part of their correspondence, there was a reference to the
      Spanish valet, Baptisto.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I told you," wrote Ellen, "Baptisto seems in excellent health, though
      he is mysterious and unpleasant as usual. He comes and goes like a ghost,
      but if he made you believe that he was ill, he was imposing upon you. I do
      so wish you had taken him with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane folded up the letter with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Baptisto!" he thought, "I suppose it is as I suspected, and the
      little widow at the lodge is at the bottom of it all."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few days' sojourn at Chelsea, during which time he was much
      interested in certain spiritualistic investigations which were just then
      being conducted by the London <i>savants</i>, to the manifest confusion of
      the spirits and indignation of true believers, Haldane went to Paris,
      where he read his paper before the French Society to which he belonged.
      There we shall leave him for a little time, returning to the company of
      Miss Dove, with whom we have more immediate concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother and son lived in a pleasant house overlooking Clapham Common, a
      district famous for its religious edification, its young ladies'
      seminaries, and its dissenting chapels. Mrs. Hethering-ton was the wealthy
      widow of a Glasgow merchant, long settled in London, and she set her face
      rigidly against modern thought, ecclesiastical vestments, and cooking on
      the sabbath. Curiously enough, her son Walter, who inherited a handsome
      competence, was a painter, and followed his heathen occupation with much
      talent, and more youthful enthusiasm. His landscapes, chiefly of Highland
      scenes, had been exhibited in the Royal Scottish Academy. His mother,
      whose highest ideas of art were founded on a superficial acquaintance with
      the Scripture pieces of Noel Paton, and an occasional contemplation of
      biblical masterpieces in the Doré Gallery, would have preferred to have
      seen him following in his fathers footsteps, and even entering the true
      kirk as a preacher; but his sympathies were pagan, and a gloomy childish
      experience had not fitted him with the requisite enthusiasm for John
      Calvin and the sabbath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter Hetherington was a fine fresh young fellow of three and twenty, and
      belonged to the clever set of Scotch painters, headed by Messrs. Pettie,
      Richardson, and Peter Graham. He was "cannie" painstaking, and rather
      sceptical, and, putting aside his art, which he really loved, he felt true
      enthusiasm for only one thing in the world&mdash;his cousin Edith, whom he
      hoped and longed to make his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a very young girl, Edith had seemed rather attached to him; but of late
      years, during which they saw each other only at long intervals, she seemed
      colder and colder to his advances. He noticed her indifference, and set it
      down somewhat angrily to girlish fanaticism, for he had little or no
      suspicion whatever that another man's image might be filling her thoughts.
      Once or twice, it is true, when she sounded the praises of her Omberley
      pastor, his zeal, his goodness, his beauty of discourse, he asked himself
      if he could possibly have a rival <i>there</i>; but knowing something of
      the relinquent fancies of young vestals, he rejected the idea. To tell the
      truth, he rather pitied the Rev. Mr. Santley, whom he had never seen, as a
      hardheaded, dogmatic, elderly creature of the type greatly approved by his
      mother, and abundant even in Clapham. He had no idea of an Adonis in a
      clerical frock coat, with a beautiful profile, white hands, and a voice
      gentle and low&mdash;the latter an excellent thing in woman, but a
      dangerous thing in an unmarried preacher of the Word.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII. WALTER HETHERINGTON.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen the party got
      home from the opera, it was only half-past ten. They sat down to a frugal
      supper in the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry you did not wait till the last act," said the young man, after
      an awkward silence. "Patti's death scene is magnificent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm thinking we heard enough," his mother replied. "I never cared much
      for play-acting, and I see little sense in screeching about in a foreign
      tongue. I'd rather have half an hour of the Reverend Mr. Mactavish's
      discourses than a night of fooling like yon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do <i>you</i> say, Edith? I'm sure the music was very pretty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it was beautiful; but not knowing much of Italian, I could not
      gather what it was all about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is an operatic version of a story of the younger Dumas," explained
      Walter, with an uncomfortable sense of treading on dangerous ground. "The
      story is that of a beautiful woman who has lived an evil life, and is
      reformed through her affection for a young Frenchman. His friends think he
      is degrading himself by offering to marry her, and to cure him she
      pretends to be false and wicked. In the end, she dies in his arms,
      broken-hearted. It is a very touching subject, I think, though some people
      consider it immoral."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the matron broke in with quiet severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder yon woman&mdash;Patti, you call her&mdash;doesn't think shame to
      appear in such dresses. One of them was scarcely decent, and I was almost
      ashamed to look at her&mdash;the creature!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But her singing, mother, her singing; was it not divine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was meeddling loud; but I've heard far finer in the kirk. Edith, my
      bairn, you're tired, I'm thinking. We'll just read a chapter, and get to
      bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the chapter was read, and the ladies retired, while Walter walked off
      to his studio to have a quiet pipe. He was too used to his mother's
      peculiarities to be much surprised at the failure of the evening's
      entertainment; but he felt really amazed that Edith had not been more
      impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, when they met at breakfast, Edith astonished both her
      aunt and cousin by expressing her wish to return to Omberley as soon as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go away already!" cried the young man. '"Why, you've hardly been here a
      week, and you've seen nothing of town, and we've all the picture-galleries
      to visit yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have not heard Mr. Mactavish discoorse," cried his mother. "No,
      no; you must bide awhile."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Edith shook her head, and they saw her mind was made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can come again at Christmas, but I would rather go now," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why have you changed your mind?" inquired her cousin eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think they want me at home; and there is a great deal of church work to
      be done in the village."
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter was not deceived by this excuse, and tried persuasion, but it was
      of no avail. The girl was determined to return home immediately. He little
      knew the real cause of her determination. Haldane's presence in London had
      filled her, in spite of herself, with jealous alarm. Ellen Haldane was
      alone at the Manor, with no husband's eyes to trouble her; and, despite
      the clergyman's oath of fidelity, Edith could not trust him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she would go home. It was time to put an end to it all, to remind
      Santley of his broken promises, and to claim their fulfilment. If he
      refused to do her justice, she would part from him for ever; not, however,
      without letting the other woman, her rival, know his true character.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was arranged that she should leave by an early train next morning. For
      the greater part of the day she kept her room, engaged in preparations for
      the journey; but towards evening Walter found her alone in the
      drawing-room. The old lady, his mother, who earnestly wished him to marry
      his cousin, had contrived to be out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so sorry you are going," the young man said. "We see so little of
      each other now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith was seated with her back to the window, her face in deep shade. She
      knew by her cousin's manner that he was more than usually agitated, and
      she dreaded what was coming&mdash;what had come, indeed, on several
      occasions before. She did not answer, but almost unconsciously heaved a
      deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does that mean that you are sorry too?" asked Walter, leaning towards her
      to see her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I am sorry," she replied, with a certain constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I could believe that. Somehow or other, Edith, it seems to me that
      you would rather be anywhere than here. Well, you have some cause; for the
      house is dreary enough, and we are all dull people. But you and I used to
      be such friends! More like brother and sister than mere cousins. Is that
      all over? Are we to drift farther and farther apart as the years pass on?
      It seems to me as if it might come to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How absurd you are!" said Edith, trying to force a laugh, but failing
      lamentably. "You know I was always fond of you and&mdash;and&mdash;of your
      mother." Walter winced under the sting of the last sentence, so
      unconsciously given.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean that at all," he exclaimed. "Of course you liked us, as
      relations like each other; but am I never to be more to you than a mere
      cousin? You know I love you, that I have loved you ever since we were boy
      and girl; and once&mdash;ah, yes, I thought you cared for me a little.
      Edith, what does it mean? Why are you so changed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith was more deeply changed than ever her cousin could guess. Had he
      been able to see her face, he would have been wonder-stricken at its
      expression of mingled shame and despair. She tried to reply; but before
      she could do so her voice was choked, and her tears began to fall. In a
      moment he was close beside her, and bending over her, with one hand
      outstretched to clasp her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, you are crying. Edith, my darling, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't touch me," she sobbed, shrinking from him. "I can't bear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, if I have said anything to pain you; and oh, my darling!
      remember it is my love that carries me away. I do love you, Edith. I wish
      to God I could prove to you how much!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand in his; but she drew it forcibly from him, and, shrinking
      still further away, entirely losing her self-control, sobbed silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't!" she exclaimed. "For pity's sake, be silent. You do not know what
      you are saying. I am not fit to become your wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved a few steps from her, and waited until her wild, hysterical
      sobbing should have ceased. She commanded herself quickly, as it the wild
      outburst which she had not been able to control had terrified her. Then
      she rose, and would have left the room, but the young man stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edith," he said, "surely you did not mean what you said just now, that
      you are not fit to become my wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she replied quickly; "I did mean it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was glad that her face, was turned from him, and that the room was in
      partial darkness. She was glad that she was able to steady her voice, and
      to give a direct reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer; she felt he was waiting for her to speak on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even if two people love each other," she said, trembling, "or only think
      they do, which is too often the case, they have no right to thoughtlessly
      contract that holy tie. There cannot be perfect happiness in this world
      without perfect spiritual communion. I know&mdash;I feel sure&mdash;that
      this does not exist between you and me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man flushed, and his brow contracted somewhat angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take time to think it over," he said quickly; "this is not your own heart
      that is speaking now. The seeds which that man, your clergyman, has been
      sowing in your heart have borne fruit. Religion is changing your whole
      nature. It is alienating you hopelessly from all to whom you are so dear;
      it is making you unjust, cruelly unkind, to yourself, but doubly so to
      others, under the shallow pretence that you are serving God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not interrupt him; but when he ceased, she put out her hand and
      said, quickly but firmly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night," he repeated. "It is so early, surely you are not going
      to-your room already? This is our last night together, remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so tired," returned the girl, wearily. "I must get a good night's
      rest, since I am to start early in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will not say another word?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that there is anything more that I can say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are angry with me, Edith. Before you go, say at least that you
      forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not angry; indeed, I am glad you have spoken. I know now I should
      never have come here. I know I must never come again."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, without another word, they parted. Edith went up to her room. Walter
      sought his, and there he remained all the evening, sitting in the
      darkness, pondering over the unaccountable change which had taken place in
      the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she was changed; but was it hopeless, and altogether unexpected?
      Might she not, with gentle care, be freed from this hateful influence of
      the Church? Walter believed that might be so. Already he seemed to see
      light through the cloud, and to trace the secret of this man's influence
      over her. Edith was imaginative and highly fanatical; he had appealed to
      her imagination. Being a High Church clergyman, he had employed two
      powerful agents&mdash;colour and form. He had scattered the shrine at
      which she worshipped with soft and durable perfumes, and had set up sacred
      symbols; and he had said, "Kneel before these; cast down all your worldly
      wishes and earthly affections." She, being intoxicated, as it were, had
      yielded to the spell. It was part of his plan, thought Walter, that she
      must neither marry nor form any other earthly tie; for was it not through
      her, and such as her, that his beloved Church was able to sustain its full
      prestige? The Church must reign supreme in her heart, as it had done in
      that of many another vestal; it was at the altar alone that her gifts of
      love and devotion must be burned. She must be sacrificed, as many others
      had been before her, and the Church would stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the young man's true view of the case. He believed it, for he had
      learnt in his home to hate other worldliness; but though he fancied he saw
      the nature of the discord, he could not as yet perceive the directest
      means of cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, when Edith, looking very pale and weary, but still very
      pretty in her simple travelling costume, came down to breakfast, she was a
      little surprised to find Walter already there. His manner was kind and
      considerate, as it had always been, and he made no reference whatever to
      what had passed between them on the previous night. They sat and carried
      on a constrained but polite conversation; but both were glad when it was
      interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Hetherington. The old lady was filled
      with genuine regret at her niece's sudden departure, and, while presiding
      at the breakfast-table, was so busy laying down plans for her speedy
      return that she did not notice that every morsel on Edith's plate remained
      untouched, and that, while sipping her tea, her eyes wandered continually
      towards the window, as if anxiously watching for the cab which was to take
      her away. Walter noticed it with pain, and remained discreetly silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the cab arrived, he left the room, ostensibly to superintend
      the removal of Ediths luggage, but in reality to be absent at the
      leave-taking between his mother and his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accompanied Edith to the station. It was merely an act of common
      courtesy, to which she could make no possible objection. On the way there
      was very little said on either side. She was silent from preoccupation,
      and he feared to tread on dangerous ground. But when they were near their
      parting, when Edith was comfortably seated in the train, and he stood by
      the open carriage door, he ventured in a covert manner to refer to what
      had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The house will be brighter in wintertime," he said, "and we shall have
      more means of amusing you. You will come back at Christmas, Edith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She started, dropped his hand, and drew herself from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I think not," she said; "it is always a busy time with us at
      Christmas. There is much to be done in the church."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was their good-bye; for before he could say more the guard noisily
      closed the carriage doors, and whistled shrilly. Mechanically Walter took
      off his hat, and stood sadly watching the train as it moved away.

      CHAPTER XVIII. CHURCH BELLS&mdash;AND A DISCORD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>dith was glad that
      the next day was Sunday. She rose early, dressed hurriedly, and went for a
      walk in the fresh morning air. She felt instinctively that she had a
      battle to fight, and that all her resources must be brought into play to
      gain her the victory. If her influence over the man was to continue, she
      knew there was one way by which she could regain it. With such pale cheeks
      and lacklustre eyes as she had brought with her from London, where, she
      asked, would her chances be against Ellen Haldane's fresh country charms?
      She must banish all painful thoughts for the present, and try to win back
      the roses which he had caused to fade.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked for above an hour; and when she returned home, she went
      straight into the garden to gather a little bouquet of flowers. Then she
      went up to her room to dress for church. When she came down to breakfast,
      she wore her prettiest costume, and the bunch of flowers was fastened at
      her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her aunt had a headache, she said, and could not go to church. Edith was
      not sorry; indeed, when the time came for her to set out, she was glad she
      was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arrived at the church rather earlier than usual, nevertheless she
      walked straight in, and no sooner had she crossed the threshold than she
      obeyed a sudden impulse which seized her, and determined for that day at
      least not to occupy her usual seat. She selected one which was some
      distance from the pulpit, but from which she could command an excellent
      view of the pew belonging to Foxglove Manor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The congregation gathered, but the Haldane's pew was empty. Edith watched
      it with feverish impatience. Presently, just as the tolling bell was about
      to cease, she saw Mrs. Haldane enter and take her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later, Mr. Santley, clothed in his white, priestly robes,
      ascended the steps of the reading-desk, and bent his beautiful head in
      prayer. As he rose to his feet, Edith, who had been watching him in
      extreme fascination, saw his gaze wandering round the church, and finally
      fix upon the face of the mistress of Foxglove Manor. She saw, or thought
      she saw, the lady's eyelids quiver and finally droop beneath that glance;
      while the clergyman arose, like a sick man suddenly restored to health,
      and began to read the lessons for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      How that morning passed Edith scarcely knew. She remained like one in a
      dream, mechanically going though the religious forms, but feeling as if
      her heart's blood was slowly ebbing away. Of one thing only she was
      conscious&mdash;that of all those upturned faces before him the clergyman
      seemed to see but one, but that from this one face seemed to draw his
      inspiration, as the earth draws life and light from the shining rays of
      the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the service was over, the congregation dispersed, and Edith
      found herself walking up and down the quiet lanes alone, panting for air,
      feeling sick at heart, and shivering through and through, though she stood
      in the warm rays of sunlight. Go home she could not. She must see Mr.
      Santley before she could face another human soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned, intending to go to the Vicarage, but when she was yet within
      some distance of the house, she saw coming towards her the very man she
      sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, not knowing whether to feel glad or sorry. It was certainly
      better than having to go to the Vicarage, yet now that the meeting was so
      near, she shrank from it. She made a desperate effort to compose herself,
      and paused, waiting for him. The clergyman was evidently lost in deep
      thought, his head was bent, his eyes were fixed on the ground, and he was
      quite close to Edith before he saw her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When their eyes met he paused, almost involuntarily, a momentary flush of
      mingled annoyance and surprise passed over his face, then he recovered
      himself, walked forward, and quietly extended his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Dove!" he said, glancing nervously round. "I had no idea you were at
      home. How do you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been agreed between them, long before, that so long as their secret
      remained a secret, no warmer greeting than this must be exchanged between
      them in public. When the proposition had been made, Edith had quietly
      assented. What was it to her that Santley should bow his head with a
      politeness even more frigid than he bestowed upon any one of his flock.
      Had she not seen the burning light of love in his half-lowered eyes? and
      had she not known that a few hours later she would feel his caressing arms
      about her, and hear his rich, mellow voice whispering tenderly in her ear?
    </p>
    <p>
      But now all was changed. The frigid bow which had formerly been the
      prologue, had rapidly developed into the play. There were no stolen
      meetings now; no consoling whisperings. The clergyman had latterly become
      alive to the risk of such indulgences, and had gradually allowed them to
      cease; and Edith, receiving as her portion the cold bow and cold handshake
      that every eye might have seen, had watched the love light gradually fade
      from her hero's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had never seen him so cold as to-day. When their eyes had met, she
      had noticed the look of positive annoyance which had passed across his
      face. It had soon fled, but when he spoke and extended his hand, his face
      had assumed a look of cold severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith did not speak; the painful beating of her heart almost stifled her,
      and her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth. She extended her hand; the
      cold, listless touch of his fingers throbbed through her like ice. The
      clergyman saw her trouble, and again that look of impatient annoyance
      passed across his face then he raised his brows in calm surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter?" he asked quickly. "Has some domestic trouble caused
      your sudden return home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She withdrew her hand from his cold, lax fingers, and answered, "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned and walked along in silence by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man was annoyed, seriously annoyed. First at her sudden
      appearance in the village, when he believed she was safely bestowed in
      London for several weeks to come; next at the <i>rôle</i> she thought fit
      to assume. He hated scenes at any time; just now he particularly wished to
      avoid one. So he walked on in silence, until he could command his voice to
      speak quietly; then he said, in the most careless manner possible&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>When</i> did you return home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last night. I attended church this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him quickly, to see what effect her words produced.
      Apparently they produced none. The clergymans face remained as coldly
      impassive as before; he raised his brows slightly as he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! I did not see you there." Then, after a pause, he added, "Your
      return was very sudden, was it not? I thought you intended staying away
      for some time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I changed my mind. I thought you would have been glad to have me back
      again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, swept on by a wild impulse, which she could not possibly restrain,
      she added slowly, but tremulously&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles, are you <i>sorry</i> I have come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman started, flushed, then quickly recovered himself, as he
      added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, my dear Edith? What a question! Why of course I am not sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, why not say that you are glad? Why not let me know it? Don't you
      see you are breaking my heart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Santley paused, and looked at her. He did not flush this time, his face
      grew white as marble, his eyes quite steel-like in their coldness. He had
      dreaded a scene, but this was so very much worse than he had expected; for
      by this time Edith had lost all self-control, and was sobbing violently.
      His face hardened terribly. He must put an end once and for ever to such
      unpleasant encounters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edith, have you lost your senses?" he said; and the bitterness of his
      tone was like putting a knife into the girl's heart. "If you wish to
      perform in such scenes as this, you could surely find some other time and
      place than the public road and the broad daylight. If you have anything to
      say to me, you must come to me again in private. At present I have no more
      time which I can place at your service. I have business with Mrs. Haldane,
      who is waiting for me at the Vicarage; and my duties at the church will
      soon begin again."
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hat, and would have moved away, but Edith laid her hand upon
      his arm and forcibly detained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop!" she cried. "One word! You shall not go. I must speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned upon her almost angrily; he attempted, but in vain, to shake off
      her detaining hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," she cried; "why are you going to meet Mrs. Haldane?" Then,
      before he could recover from his astonishment sufficiently to speak, she
      added, "You need not tell me, for I <i>know</i>. It is this woman who has
      come between you and me. Oh, do you think I don't know that since she came
      to the village you have been a changed man? What did I come home for?
      Because I knew it was not right that you and she should be in the village
      <i>alone</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the clergyman succeeded in shaking off her hand. The face which
      he turned towards hers was almost livid in its pallor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget yourself," he said, with a sternness which was even harder to
      bear than bitter reproach. "Well, I suppose you think you have a right to
      insult me; but permit me to remind you that your right does not extend to
      religious affairs, or to a lady who is the most esteemed member of my
      congregation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not insulted you, Charles; I am only warning you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind," he interposed, with a sneer, "but I am, in no greater
      need of your warning than is the lady. Until you can learn how to control
      your own words and actions, it would be better for <i>you</i> that we
      should not meet." Again he moved, as if about to leave her; again she put
      forth her hand, and held him fast. The scene had become more violent than
      she had intended. It was now too late to pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One more word," she sobbed. "Promise me that you will not see her, then I
      will promise never to mention this subject again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Promise you what? To discontinue all communications with Mrs. Haldane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; that is all. It is not much to ask you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is much more than you have any right to ask. You have chosen to
      connect my name dishonourably with a lady whom I esteem. Enough! I cannot
      control your actions, but I mean to regulate my own. Good morning, Edith.
      Since you have nothing more important to say to me, I suppose I am at
      liberty to go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hat and walked away, pausing a minute later to raise it
      again, and to address some pleasant remark to a member of his
      congregation, who happened at that moment to be coming along the road. It
      was the sight of this stranger which prevented Edith from following, which
      made her turn and walk with rapid steps towards her home. She felt cold
      and sick and heart-broken, and she shrank from the sight of any human
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached her home, she found her aunt, who had been surprised at
      her protracted absence, gazing uneasily up and down the road. The sight of
      the girl's pale, tear-stained face alarmed her, but Edith silenced her
      inquiries by declaring that she had not been very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was foolish of me, but I could not help crying at the service," she
      said. "Dear aunt, do not be anxious. I am better now, and only want rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I send you up some dinner, darling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; nothing. I want to be alone&mdash;quite alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with a weary, listless look upon her, the girl went up to her room,
      and, having locked the door, she threw herself upon the bed, and cried as
      if her heart were broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mr. Santley went on his way, almost as much disturbed as Edith
      herself. He was angry, terribly angry; for if scenes similar to the one
      through which he had passed were allowed to continue, he anticipated a
      storm of troubles in the future. But how to avoid them? What would be the
      best and safest course to adopt? The good man was terribly perplexed. To
      openly defy the girl might cause her, in her bitterness and pain, to
      expose herself and him; which would certainly be awkward, since he wished,
      above all things, to stand well with his congregation. And yet to adopt
      any other course, he must at least pretend to subscribe to her conditions.
      He must be content to renounce, or pretend to renounce, his intimacy with
      Mrs. Haldane. The man of God was justly indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a course, he knew, must not be thought of, and he resolved with pious
      determination to continue Ellen Haldane's conversion, for which he was so
      zealous and to leave matters between himself and Edith exactly as they
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew the girl's disposition. She would soon acknowledge her folly, and
      make the first advances towards reconciliation. Well, then he would be
      inclined to meet her half-way, but she must be the first to move. If, on
      the other hand, she chose to take the unpleasant course of exposing him,
      why, he would have but one alternative: he would simply deny her
      statements, and who would believe her? It would be an unpleasant phase of
      experience to have to pass through, and it would compel him to sacrifice a
      fellow-creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he acknowledged to himself, with the air of a Christian
      martyr, that if she pushed him to extremities it would be necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, he hoped that Edith, shut up with her own grief, in the
      solitude of her own room, would soon be brought to see the error of her
      ways, and would make that first advance towards reconciliation which was
      necessary for the peace of mind of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, whatever might happen in the future, Edith had succeeded for that day
      at least in completely destroying the good mans peace of mind. His
      agitation was so great that he was compelled to walk about the quiet lanes
      until his tranquillity was somewhat restored. Then he returned to the
      Vicarage, where Mrs. Haldane was comfortably seated with his sister, and
      enjoyed her society until the hour of his labours returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered the church that afternoon, all the congregation thought he
      was looking more seraphic than ever. Many a young heart fluttered with
      holiness, and many an eyelid drooped reverently, before the calm serenity
      of his gaze. As he stood facing his people, he cast his eyes around the
      church. Edith was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the leaves of his gold-clasped volume, and as his rich voice
      filled the church, and the congregation rose, he gazed once more about
      him. This time his cheek flushed slightly, and a soft sigh of relief and
      happiness escaped his parted lips. Mrs. Haldane was again in her place,
      calmly joining in the prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon the clergyman preached like one inspired; all were
      impressed but none were cognizant of the cause. Though the clergyman's
      eyes wandered continually around the church, he saw only one face, was
      conscious only of one presence. So engrossed was he, and so wrapped up in
      his fervour of admiration, that he did not notice what was going on around
      him. Had he done so, he would have seen that there was another member of
      the congregation besides Mrs. Haldane who attracted a certain amount of
      interest. Seated in the gallery, calmly joining in the service and
      watching the minister, was the foreign "gentleman with the eyes."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX. HE IS BUT A LANDSCAPE PAINTER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter Edith's
      departure from London, Walter Hetherington thought long and deeply over
      the mysterious change in his cousin. The more he thought, the more uneasy
      he grew. Of one thing he felt tolerably sure&mdash;that the girl had got
      into the hands of, a religious fanatic, who either consciously or
      unconsciously was completely destroying himself, his happiness&mdash;in
      this world at least. She was fairly possessed by the fever of other
      worldliness, he said to himself, and if left alone she would, like many
      others before her, probably end her days in a mad house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having arrived at this enlightened conclusion, which was chiefly based on
      what Edith had herself told him, Walter determined that she should not be
      left alone. What would be more rational, he said to himself, than that he
      should pack up his sketching paraphernalia and pay a short visit to the
      picturesque little village where his aunt and cousin lived? Surely Edith
      would be glad to see him, and while he remained to watch over her, his
      time would not be entirely lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he told his mother of his determination to revisit the country, the
      old lady was unfeignedly glad. She suspected, from the unaccountable
      sudden departure of the girl, that the two young people had had a quarrel,
      and she was glad to see her son was magnanimous enough to make the first
      advances towards reconciliation. So she helped him to put a few things
      together, and on the spur of the moment he started off.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had written neither to his cousin nor aunt to tell them of his coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;He had intended sending a telegram from the station, but at the
      last moment he changed his mind, and as he sat in the train which was
      rapidly whirling him onward, he began to ask himself whether it would be
      judicious of him to go to his aunt's house at all. To be sure, he had
      always made it his head-quarters; but now things were changed. Edith had
      left his mother's house to avoid <i>him</i>; would it be fair to either of
      them that he should become his aunt's guest? By living in the house he
      would force from her a communication which might be very grudgingly given,
      and at the same time his lips must be inevitably sealed. He finally
      decided that, during the visit at least, it would be better for every one
      that he should stay at the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      So on arriving at the station he drove to the inn, secured at a cheap
      price a couple of cosy rooms, and determined to delay calling upon his
      relations until the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day was fine, a fit day for an artist to lounge, dream, perhaps
      work. Walter hung about the inn till midday; then he took his sketch-book
      under his arm, and strolled forth in the direction of his aunt's cottage.
      When he reached the door, and was about to knock, it was suddenly opened
      by Edith, dressed in walking costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      On coming thus unexpectedly face to face with her cousin, she looked
      manifestly angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Walter, you here?" she said coldly; then she added quickly, "Is anything
      the matter at home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing whatever," said Walter, quietly giving his hand, and taking no
      notice whatever of the irritation so plainly visible on her face. "I got
      tired of London, that was all, and thought a few days in the country might
      do me good. I am not going to bore <i>you</i>. I have brought my working
      tools down with me, and mean to take some sketches back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where is your luggage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Down at the inn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the inn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I had it taken direct there last night. I was fortunate enough, too,
      to secure rooms&mdash;a capital little parlour fit for a studio, and a
      bedroom leading out of it. I shall be able to do the host, and entertain
      you, if you'll come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to stay at the inn?" said Edith. "You always stayed with <i>us</i>
      before!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I did; but I am not going to be so inconsiderate as to plant
      myself upon you <i>now</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid the slightest possible stress upon the "now," and Edith
      understood; nevertheless, she deemed it prudent to affect ignorance and
      read a different meaning in his words. She murmured something about being
      very much occupied, and having little time to attend to visitors; then led
      the way across the hall to their sitting-room, and brought him into the
      presence of his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Russell welcomed him cordially, but when she heard of his domestic
      arrangements, her face went very blank indeed. She used every argument in
      her power to persuade the young man to change his mind, and to have his
      luggage brought up to the cottage. Walter, eager to accept her kindness,
      was listening for one word from Edith. It never came, and he expressed his
      intention to remain at the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, although he abided by his former decision and remained <i>en garçon</i>
      at the inn, a very great part of his time was spent at the cottage. The
      old lady, anxious to atone for the inhospitable behaviour of her niece,
      altered all her household arrangements to suit the erratic habits of the
      young painter. The heavy midday meal was replaced by a light luncheon;
      while for the light supper at six was substituted a substantial dinner, to
      which Walter was always bidden. On the afternoon of that day, when the
      young man had first made his appearance at the cottage, a rather
      unpleasant interview had taken place between the aunt and niece, almost
      the first which had come to ruffle the peaceful course of their evenly
      flowing lines. The old lady had been indignant at the coolness of Edith's
      reception, and had accused the girl of inhospitality and ingratitude;
      while Edith had coolly given it as her opinion that the young man was much
      better located elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a tax to have a visitor always in the house, aunt," said Edith,
      quietly; "and&mdash;and I haven't the strength to bear it, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Russell looked up, and was surprised to find that the girl, after
      bearing her reproaches so mildly, was now actually crying. She noted
      again, too, with a start of shocked surprise how sadly she had changed.
      The fresh, bright beauty which had once charmed every eye had gone,
      leaving scarcely a trace behind it, and the face was pale, careworn, and
      sad. She got up and kissed her, and that silent caress did more than a
      dozen reproaches. It made Edith hurriedly leave the room, to cast herself,
      crying bitterly, upon the bed, while Mrs. Russell sat down and wrote a
      note to Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have your own way about staying at the inn," she wrote, "and
      you shall also have every possible hour of the day that you can make use
      of for your work; but surely you can spare your evenings for us. I have
      arranged to dine every day at six, and I beg of you, for Edith's sake, to
      make one of the party. Dear Edith is far from well, and sadly changing.
      She sees so few people, and the house is dull. Dear Walter, come often,
      for her sake if not for mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it happened that every night, when the little dining-room was laid
      out for dinner, Walter made his appearance at the cottage door, and that
      during those evening hours the family party was increased to three.
      Sometimes they left the dinner-table to lounge in the pretty little
      drawing-room, where Walter was permitted to smoke his cigar, while the old
      lady worked at wool-work, and Edith played to them in the slowly gathering
      darkness. Sometimes they strolled out on to the lawn, and had the tea
      brought out, and laughed and chatted while they watched the stars appear
      one by one in the heavens. Was it fancy, or since these social evenings
      commenced was Edith really changed' for the better? Walter fancied that
      her eye was brighter, her cheek less pale, and that her manner towards
      himself was sometimes very tender, as if she wished in a measure to atone
      for her past coldness. This was particularly noticeable one night when the
      two sat alone in the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Russell, murmuring something about household affairs, had left them
      together. Walter was reclining in an armchair, smoking his cigar and
      watching his cousin, who was busily engaged embroidering crosses upon a
      handsome altar-cloth, intended for the decoration of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These have been pleasant evenings," he said&mdash;"pleasant for me, that
      is. I shall be sorry enough when they come to an end."
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith looked up and smiled sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we always had pleasure it would become a pain," she said. "Though we
      rebel against pain and suffering, it is, after all, a very great boon to
      the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! Perhaps so, if it were better distributed. What about the poor
      creatures whose portion is only pain?&mdash;who, to put it vulgarly, get
      all the kicks, and none of the halfpence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this world, you should have said, Walter. Let us hope their measure of
      happiness will be greater in the world that is to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter was silent. The conversation had taken precisely the turn which he
      would have avoided, and he was wondering how to bring it to the subject
      which was for ever uppermost in his mind. For a time he remained in a
      brown study. Edith stitched on. Then he rose, took a few turns about the
      room, and stopped near to her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edith," he said quietly, "do you know why I came down here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in his tone rather than his words made her start and flush
      painfully. She did not raise her eyes or cease her work. Before she could
      answer, he had taken her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came for <i>you</i>, Edith," he continued passionately. "Listen to me,
      my darling. Do not answer hastily, if you cannot give me a decided answer.
      At least let me hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      Decidedly yet tremblingly the girl put his hands from her, and half rose
      from her seat. His words had frozen her to ice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why <i>did</i> you come here?" she said. "Do you call it manly or kind to
      persecute me? I tell you I shall never marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke her eye fell upon the altar-cloth, which she held in her
      hand: Walter saw the look, and as he was walking back to the inn that
      night it recurred to his mind again. The altar-cloth! There was the symbol
      of the thing which had come between them&mdash;which was blighting his
      life and hers. Edith was changing; but she was not utterly changed. He
      resolved to do the only thing which now remained to be done. He determined
      to appeal to her spiritual adviser.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night his mind was filled with this idea; it troubled his sleeping as
      well as his waking moments, and when he rose in the morning it was the one
      thing which possessed him. Now, he had never seen the clergyman, but he
      had pictured him as a middle-aged, benevolent-looking man, perhaps with
      spectacles; a gentle fanatic in religion, willing, through the very
      bigotry of his nature, to sacrifice everything for the good of the Church,
      but still, perhaps, amiable. He might be open to reason, and an appeal
      made directly to him might be the means of putting an end to all the
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast over, the young man issued from the inn, and strolled
      deliberately through the village in the direction of the Vicarage. It was
      early in the day to make a call, so he walked very slowly, meditating as
      he went on the nature of his errand; and the course he was about to take,
      after what had passed between him and his cousin, was, perhaps, a little
      unwarrantable, and Edith might be inclined to resent it if she knew. But
      then, he reflected, she need never know. Mr. Santley would surely grant
      him the favour of keeping the matter a secret; and afterwards, when the
      shadow of the Church had ceased to darken her life, and she was happy with
      him in her married home, she would be glad to hear that it was he who had
      saved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the kind of rose-coloured visions which filled his brain as he
      walked on towards the Vicarage, and by the time he had reached the hall
      door and pulled the bell, he had even converted Mr. Santley into the good
      fairy of the tale, or rather a sort of Father Christmas, in a surplice,
      smiling benevolently upon them and pairing their hands. A trim little
      servant came to the door, and, in answer to his inquiries, informed him
      that Mr. Santley was not at home. He was expected in immediately, however,
      if the gentleman would like to wait.. Yes; Walter would wait. So he
      followed the little maid across the hall, into a somewhat chilly but
      sufficiently gorgeous room, which was reserved solely for the comfort and
      convenience of Mr. Santley's guests. As Walter sank down into an
      easy-chair, the arms of which seemed to enfold him in a close embrace, and
      looked about the room, he acknowledged that Mr. Santley at least did not
      give all his substance to the poor. Here at least there was no appearance
      of penury, or of sackcloth and ashes; all was comfortable and luxurious in
      the extreme. He walked about the room; examined the books upon the tables,
      which were all works of education, elegantly bound; noticed the engravings
      on the walls&mdash;one or two of Raphael's Madonnas (coloured copies), and
      an old engraving after Andrea del Sarto. Mr. Santley did not come. He rang
      the bell, gave the little maid his card, told her he would call again, and
      left the Vicarage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time he walked in the direction of the schoolhouse. He had his
      sketchbook under his arm, and in it a half-finished sketch of the
      schoolmistress's picturesque home. He would fill up his spare time by
      adding a few touches to the sketch before he returned to the Vicarage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this matter fortune favoured him. It being Saturday afternoon, there
      was no school, and the schoolmistress was leaning in a listless attitude
      upon the low trellised gate. She welcomed the young painter with a nod and
      a bright smile, and readily assented to his proposition that she should
      stand for the figure in the picture. He took out his book and set to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora meanwhile chatted and laughed to make the time pass pleasantly, and
      sometimes, in answer to an invitation from him, she would run round the
      easel to take a peep at the figure of herself, which was gradually growing
      under his hand. At last their pleasant interview was brought to an end.
      Walter remembered the appointment which this chattering lady had made him
      forget. He put up his sketching materials, and prepared to take his leave.
      Then Dora stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely, Mr. Hetherington, you will do me one favour," she said: "you will
      honour me by stepping for a moment into the cottage which you have
      transferred so beautifully to paper. I have some cream and milk, some
      fresh strawberries from our garden, if that is any inducement to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The invitation was tempting. Nevertheless, Walter, while wishing to
      accept, was about to refuse, pleading an engagement at the Vicarage when
      another voice broke in&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good day, Miss Greatheart!" it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The schoolmistress smiled, made a prim curtsey, and answered, "Good day,
      sir!" Then she waited to see if her visitor had anything more to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new arrival was a man, and Walter, who was looking at him, thought he
      was the handsomest man he had ever seen in his life. He was dressed as a
      clergyman, but the cut of his garments-was elegant and eminently becoming.
      As his eye fell upon Walter he raised his hat, and discovered a head
      beautifully shaped and slightly thinning at the temples. Walter remained
      fascinated, staring at the man, who moved here and there with easy grace,
      and whose face grew singularly handsome with every varying expression
      which flitted across it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not much to say to the schoolmistress; and as he moved away his hat
      was again swept off to Walter, and the clergyman's eyes rested upon him
      for a moment with a look one might love to paint in the eyes of a saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter turned to Miss Greatheart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A handsome fellow," he said, "&mdash;a very handsome fellow; and a
      clergyman, I see, by his dress. Who is he? One of Mr. Santley's curates, I
      suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The schoolmistress stared at him for a moment in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of Mr. Santley's curates!" she said. "Why, my dear sir, that is our
      vicar himself!"

      CHAPTER XX. IN THE GLOAMING.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> t was now Walters
      turn to look amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That Mr. Santley!" he said. "Why, he is quite a young man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course he is&mdash;and handsome as good, and good as handsome. But
      won't you come in, Mr. Hetherington, and have some refreshment? It is two
      hours quite since you opened out your sketch-book at the gate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Walter accepted her invitation, and followed her into the quaint
      little parlour, where most of her days were spent. The little maid who
      attended to the house had got a holiday with the children, and Dora was
      left to attend to herself that day. Walter was glad of it, since he was
      left free to sit by the window and follow the train of his thoughts, while
      Dora busied herself spreading the snowy cloth upon the table, and setting
      forth her simple fare. When it was ready, he came to the table and ate
      some strawberries and drank some milk, thinking all the while of Mr.
      Santley. Presently he spoke of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have known Mr. Santley some time, Miss Greatheart?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was schoolmistress here when he came."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a very good man, you said?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed. But it stands to reason that a man with Mr. Santley's gifts
      must be very good indeed not to get spoiled. In justice to at least half
      of his congregation, he ought to marry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? If he had arrived here with a wife, many a young girl in the village
      would have been saved a severe heartache. He is a prize in the matrimonial
      lottery well worth striving for. He is idolized by every female in the
      village. Now, it is certain he cannot marry them all, and on the day when
      the happy one is chosen, fancy the hearts that will break!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours amongst the number?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir; I am happy to say I am free. But I take no credit to myself on
      that account. If I had been idle like some of the young ladies here, there
      might have been another victim added to the list; but I have so much to do
      in the school, I have no time to think about the vicar," she added. "Have
      you heard him preach, Mr. Hetherington?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you must go to the church tomorrow. He speaks magnificently, and
      looks a picture in his robes; besides, his sister, Miss Santley, told me
      he will wear for the first time to-morrow a new surplice and a magnificent
      embroidered band, which has been worked for him by Miss Dove!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of his cousin's name Walter felt his face flush and his
      heart leap; but he made no direct reply. He went on eating his
      strawberries, and turned his face to the open window, as he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you made for him, Miss Greatheart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I? Oh, nothing! He has so many beautiful presents from the young ladies
      in the village that he has no need of them from me, even if I had the time
      to make them, which I have not; all day I am teaching in the school, and
      all the evening I am busy preparing lessons for the following day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you always lived here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not always. My mother was a prison matron at Preston, and we lived
      together until she died, several years ago; then, through the influence of
      some friends, I got this place, and have lived here ever since!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Working and striving," added Walter; "finding pleasure in things which to
      some would mean only trouble and irritation. During the holidays do you
      ever come to London, Miss Greatheart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I generally remain here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From choice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all. I should like a change; but then, to go alone to a city where
      you have no friends, and to parade crowded streets alone, is a holiday
      which I should not enjoy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will come back and finish the sketch on Monday, perhaps?" said Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be glad to; I should like, above all, to finish the figure
      leaning on the gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you must come in the evening. I promise to give you an hour after
      school hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Walter shook hands with her and left, taking the way to the inn
      instead of to the Vicarage. He would make no appeal to the clergyman. The
      sight of Mr. Santley, so different to the benevolent, elderly gentleman of
      his imagination, had decided him on that point; it had also brought with
      it other trouble, for it threw an entirely new light on Edith's religious
      fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it, then, the man or the church, infatuation or fanaticism? He asked
      himself the question for the first time. Was Edith among the mass of
      simple girls who were breaking their hearts for his sake? Probably. It
      remained now for him to watch her, and ascertain the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up to the cottage that evening, and regarded Edith with quite a
      new light in his eyes. She also seemed changed. Her manner was restless
      and ill at ease; her cheek was flushed. All through the dinner she
      scarcely touched any food, but glanced furtively at her aunt and cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the dinner was over, they all retired to the drawing-room as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Ediths restlessness asserted itself more strongly. Instead of sitting
      quietly to her work, as was her usual custom, she flitted restlessly about
      the room. Presently she declared that she had a terrible headache, and
      wished her cousin "good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been trying to bear it," she said, "but it gets worse instead of
      better. You will excuse me for to-night, Walter, will you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he took her hand and held it for a moment in his, he felt that it was
      trembling and very hot. He scarcely believed in the headache, but he
      deemed silence the most prudent course; so he wished her "good night"
      without more ado.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her aunt rose to go with her to her room, but permission to do so was
      firmly refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will stay and keep Walter company, or else you will make me regret I
      did not bear the pain without a word. Indeed, dear aunt, all I want is
      rest and quietness. I shall be quite well to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      So she went. Mrs. Russell sat down again to her wool-work, and Walter
      subsided into his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much talking done after that, and Walter, as soon as his
      cigar was finished, rose to take his leave. The old lady looked at him
      tenderly and sadly, but she said nothing. Instinct had told her the true
      state of, things between the cousins; she was sorry, but helpless. It
      would be better, she thought to herself, if the poor boy would resign a
      useless courtship, since Edith had evidently no affection to give, and
      take to himself some pretty little wife who would make his home happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not return directly to the inn, but with head bent in deep thought
      he strolled on, he knew not whither. He was wondering whether or not this
      hopeless quest should end. If Edith had deceived him&mdash;if, indeed, it
      was the man, and not religion, which held the girl so entranced&mdash;why,
      then his task of regeneration would surely be a very difficult one. It was
      strange, he thought, that Edith, knowing his mistake, should have allowed
      it to remain. He had repeatedly spoken to her of Mr. Santley as an elderly
      man; and, although she knew the truth, she had never corrected him. It
      looked black, very black; the more he thought over it, the more
      complicated matters became.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been so engrossed in his own thoughts, that he had been almost
      unaware of his own actions. He was only conscious of strolling idly on and
      on, he knew not in what direction. Suddenly he paused, looked helplessly
      about him; then took a few stealthy steps forward, and paused again. Where
      he was he did not know. The night had grown quite dark and chilly, for
      heavy, rain-charged clouds were covering both stars and moon. But his
      quick ear had detected what his eyes could not at first perceive&mdash;the
      close neighbourhood of two figures in earnest conversation&mdash;a man and
      a woman. The darkness shrouded their figures, but the breeze brought to
      him the sound of their voices. Walter hated to play the spy, yet for once
      in his life his feet refused to move. For he had recognized one of the
      voices as belonging to his cousin Edith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the voice was Ediths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having wished her aunt and cousin "good night," she had hastened to her
      room and locked the door; but instead of throwing herself on the bed, she
      had lit the candles, sat down near the dressing-table, drawn forth a
      letter from her pocket, and begun to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Miss Dove,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry to hear that you have been suffering. You will find what
      you require at Dr. Spruce's surgery. You are right about the time&mdash;nine
      o'clock will do very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours faithfully,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles Santley."
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter had come through the post in the ordinary way. It had been
      handed to Edith in the morning; and the very sight of it had sent the hot
      blood coursing through her veins, and kept her in a state of feverish
      excitement the whole day. It was the knowledge of this piece of paper in
      her pocket which had rendered her so uneasy during the dinner; it was the
      knowledge of this letter also which had caused her excitement after
      dinner, and which finally had made her wish her cousin a hasty "good
      night." And now, as she read it again, the flush remounted to her cheeks
      and her heart beat pleasantly. She had not seen Santley alone since that
      Sunday morning, nearly a week past, when the two had parted in anger&mdash;an
      anger which to Edith meant utter misery and prostration. And now, at the
      eleventh hour, he had written to her appointing a meeting, and she was
      ready to fly to him with open arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat for some time looking at the letter, reading it over and over
      until she knew every word of it by heart; then she kissed it, returned it
      to her pocket, opened the window, and looked out. It was a cloudy but fine
      night, and the welcome darkness was gathering quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it would only rain, she thought, they would be sure to have the road to
      themselves in that case; and for herself, why, what did it matter so long
      as she felt her lovers arms about her again, and knew that he was true?
      But now her first care was to effect her escape stealthily from the house.
      She had decided upon her course of action; the great difficulty which
      remained was to carry it through. She hastily put on her walking boots,
      took up a cloak of sombre colour, fastened it round her, drew the hood
      over her head, and stood ready to set forth to the place of meeting&mdash;which
      she knew, by old experience, well.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened her bedroom door and listened. She could hear nothing. Perhaps
      her cousin was gone, perhaps he was still sitting in the drawingroom,
      quietly smoking his cigar. In any case, it seemed, she need not fear
      interruption; the way was clear. She hastily blew out her candles, locked
      her door, and slipped the key into her pocket; then noiselessly descending
      the stairs, she left the house unseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the garden she hesitated, curious to know what they could all be doing;
      so she crept round the house and peeped in at the drawing-room window.
      Walter was still there, but he stood near the door, holding his aunts
      hand, and evidently taking his leave. Edith turned, and without more ado
      fled quickly in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as Edith was leaving the cottage, Santley was already at the
      meeting-place, walking with impatient strides up and down the lonely lane
      selected for their interview, and wondering as every minute passed away
      why Edith did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week's reflection, and the frequent sight of Edith's pale, careworn face
      when they met in public, had brought him to this pass. He saw that she was
      suffering, and for the sake of what she had been to him he felt really
      sorry. Besides, he looked at the matter philosophically, and he asked
      himself, why <i>should</i> they quarrel? After all, she had been very
      patient and forbearing; and for that little fit of jealousy about Mrs.
      Haldane she had been sufficiently punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps there was another and a stronger motive for this sudden wish
      for a meeting and a reconciliation. So long as this absurd quarrel
      continued, it was evident Edith had no intention of visiting the Vicarage;
      and this fact alone subjected him to a series of unpleasant questions from
      his sister. Santley therefore decided that it would be better for him in
      every possible way to send the letter, which would be certain to effect a
      reconciliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it you, Edith? Quick! Is it you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His quick ear had caught the rustle of her dress on the grass. Even as the
      words left his lips came the eager answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Charles; I have come!" And the girl, forgetting all their quarrels,
      leapt with a glad cry into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time no words were spoken. After that one cry of joy, Edith had laid
      her head upon his shoulder and sobbed as if her heart would break. At this
      manifestation of hysteria, Santley was not altogether pleased; but he
      could say nothing, so he clasped his arms firmly about her, and tried to
      soothe her sorrow. When at last Edith lifted her head from his shoulder he
      kissed her lips, and whispered to her so gently that the girl's heart beat
      as gladly as it had done the first day that words like these had been
      spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there," said the good man, kissing her again, and patting her head
      like that of a spoilt child. "You are better now, my darling; and remember
      you must not quarrel with me again. You were breaking your little heart
      for nothing at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of the girls emotion had communicated itself to him; and for the time
      being, while he stood there holding her to him, feeling her breath upon
      her cheek, her clinging arms about his neck, he felt almost as
      passionately disposed as he had done the first day that he told her of his
      love. As for Edith, a serene happiness and peace seemed to enter into her
      soul. They stood thus for some time, exchanging whispered words and fond
      embraces; then the clergyman told her she had better go. A spot or two of
      rain had fallen, and the sky was clouding over as if for a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you play the organ to-morrow, Edith?" he asked, as they moved away
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if you wish it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do wish it, Edith; for when you are playing, it seems as if you were
      helping me with my work."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet words! She said nothing, but the hand which lay in his pressed his
      fondly, and he knew that she was pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And will you come to the Vicarage to-morrow afternoon, and have tea with
      us? I shall be so glad if you will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not add that his sister, wondering all the week at Edith's
      non-appearance, had threatened repeatedly to call at the cottage, when she
      would doubtless have elicited something of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I cannot come!" she said; "my cousin, Walter Hetherington, is staying
      in the village, and so long as he remains here he is to spend the evenings
      with us. As to-morrow is Sunday, and no work can be done, my aunt has
      invited him up for the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Santley was relieved, very much relieved indeed. He could now give his
      sister a tangible reason for Edith's absence from the Vicarage, while he
      himself would be perfectly free to spend the afternoon with Mrs. Haldane.
      He tried, to suppress the delight which he could not help feeling, and
      said quietly, "Let us hope the young man will make a speedy departure, if
      he means to monopolize you so much. But that reminds me, Edith, a young
      man, a Mr. Walter Hetherington, called upon me to-day and left his card. I
      suppose it is the same?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course it is," returned Edith. "But what could he want with <i>you?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't in the least know. Nothing of very great importance, I suppose,
      since he promised to call again, and never reappeared."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come now to within a short distance of Edith's home. Again, after
      a furtive look round, he clasped her fondly to him, pressed her lips, and
      murmured, "Good night, my Edith!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night," returned the girl, withdrawing herself reluctantly from his
      embrace. "Oh, I am so happy now! You were quite right, dear; another week
      like the last would have broken my heart!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they parted&mdash;Edith, happy as a child, creeping quickly to the
      cottage; the good man smiling celestially, and well pleased to have made
      everything comfortable at little personal inconvenience, walking back to
      his holy hearth, and thinking of his Sunday sermon.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. IN THE VICARAGE PARLOUR.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>early the whole of
      this interview had been witnessed by Walter Hetherington. He had heard,
      yet he had not heard; for, though instinct told him that the voice was
      Edith's, he could only catch fragments of what she said. Nevertheless, as
      he remained crouched in the shadow of the trees, he was conscious of sobs
      and tears, of stolen kisses and softly murmured words. He remained until
      the interview was over; then, when the two walked together back towards
      the village, he still very stealthily followed them. When they stopped
      again, he heard the passionate words of parting. His suspicions were, in
      his own despite, fast becoming certainties; they were soon established
      certainties beyond a doubt. He followed the girl after she had left her
      lover, and saw her stealthily open the door and disappear across the
      threshold of Edith's home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Walter turned, and feeling like one who has had a terrible nightmare,
      he walked back to his lodgings at the inn. He was sorry he had not had
      time to follow the man, for he remained completely in the dark as to who
      he might be. He got little sleep that night. The next morning he awoke
      sadly unrefreshed. After breakfast he strolled out among the meadows; and
      when he heard the bells ring, calling the villagers to prayer, he entered
      the church with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the congregation had assembled and the clergyman was in his place,
      Walter looked about for Edith. He felt almost a sense of relief when he
      saw that she was present; it repulsed him to think of her calmly joining
      in the service after the events of last night. He looked at the gallery
      where the school children bestowed themselves, and saw Dora, quiet,
      unobtrusive, and happy, sitting serenely amongst her flaxen-haired flock.
      How cosy, how comfortable she was! but the very bitterness of his heart
      compelled him to ask himself the question: was she as bad as the rest? At
      one time, yes, even so late as the preceding night, he had possessed so
      much blind faith in genuine human nature as to believe that the face
      indicated the soul. Now, however, he felt that such a belief was puerile
      and false. No woman on earth could possess a more spiritual countenance
      than his cousin Edith&mdash;yet his eyes had assured him of the blackness
      and impurity of her soul. Disappointment was turning his heart to gall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the service was ended: the congregation streamed forth, Walter
      amongst the rest. The crush was so great he could hardly get along&mdash;for
      Mr. Santley was a popular preacher. Once outside the edifice, Walter
      paused to draw his breath and look about him. He started, turned first
      hot, then cold, for not many yards from him was Edith herself, calmly
      leaving the church with the rest. Almost before he could recover himself
      she saw him, and advanced with a bright smile and outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw you in church," she said, "and thought you looked dreadfully pale.
      Are you not well, Walter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He murmured something about late hours and a sleepless night; then he had
      to confess he had been looking about for her, for he added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not see <i>you</i> in church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you would not. I was in the organ-room. It is my Sunday for playing,
      you remember!"
    </p>
    <p>
      To this he made no reply. He was wondering how it was that Edith could
      manage so effectually to play such a double part. He expected at least a
      downcast eye, and a blush of guilt upon her cheek; with this he might have
      been tolerably satisfied. But Edith's face looked brighter than it had
      done for many a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forgot to ask you," he said suddenly, "if your headache was better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My headache?" she replied. She had been so engrossed with happy thoughts
      at the reconciliation, that the question took her completely by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah yes," she added, suddenly recollecting herself; "it is so much better,
      that I had quite forgotten it. You see what a good night's rest will do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter uttered an impatient sigh, and turned on his heel; while Edith
      added&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are coming up to dine with us to-day, you know. Shall we walk
      together?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not coming!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not coming? I thought&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I did accept your aunt's invitation; but I feel upset to-day, and am
      not fit company for anyone. Will you make my excuses at home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly I will; and I hope that to-morrow you will be so much
      better. Good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook hands with him, and tripped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time Walter made no attempt to move, but gazed after her with eyes
      full of sadness and despair. Although he said to himself that henceforth
      Edith must be nothing to him, he felt pained at the curtness with which
      she could dismiss him. He had noticed that she had never once attempted to
      persuade him to alter his decision; indeed, she had not been able to hide
      from him her delight at hearing it, and he felt very bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned from the church, walked away, and, after strolling about for
      some time he knew not whither, he raised his head and found himself quite
      close to the schoolmistress's cottage. Dora stood in the doorway,
      surrounded by her flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came forward when she saw him, and, after giving him a bright smile
      and a warm handshake, stood by the gate and continued to talk. She was a
      wise little woman, and knew exactly what to say and what to leave unsaid;
      she had been a witness of the interview between the cousins in the
      churchyard that morning, and her woman's instinct had divined something of
      the true state of things. So she chatted pleasantly to the young man, and
      took no notice whatever of his pale cheek and peculiarity of manner; and
      when he said suddenly, "Are you not going to ask me in to-day, Miss
      Greatheart?" she threw open the gate at once, and said that she was sadly
      neglectful and inhospitable, and that if Mr. Hetherington would like to
      come in, he would be more than welcome. So he followed her again into the
      quaint little parlour, and again took his seat by the open window, to gaze
      with strange, meditative eyes upon the little garden where the sun was
      shining. It was a ragged little garden enough, and by no means well cared
      for, since Dora was not rich enough to pay for labour, like her more
      fortunate neighbours in the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      During her leisure hours she worked among the flower-beds until her plump
      hands ached again; but, after all, her leisure hours were very few, and
      the grass and weeds grew so quickly. Walter saw that the grass was many
      inches too long, and that it was scattered thickly with withered
      rose-leaves; that here and there a rose tree was sadly in want of the
      pruning knife. But that did not make the scent of the flowers any the less
      delicious; nor did it take from the quiet beauty of their place. There was
      plenty of light and colour everywhere, and there was beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      While looking at the garden, Walter began to think of the gardens mistress&mdash;quiet
      little Dora, living so contented among her children; and in the winter
      still living here alone, when the flowers had faded, when withered
      rose-leaves were scattered profusely on the grass, and the leafless
      branches of the trees bent before the biting breath of the bitter winter
      wind. It was a pretty picture of Dora&mdash;he loved it as we love the
      creatures of our imagination; it seemed to make Dora belong to him,
      artistically, as it were, and bring him consolation. Then his reflections
      took another turn, and he began, for the first time, to think it strange
      that the little woman should be so much alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said something of this to Dora; and she laughed and blushed, and
      answered frankly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am a good deal alone. You see, I am in an equivocal position. I am
      too good for the servants, and not good enough for their mistresses. I am
      only the governess!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate," said Walter, "you have contrived to brighten up what would
      otherwise have been a very cheerless visit. As a token of my gratitude,
      will you accept a little present from me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want no present, sir; your friendly words are quite enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! I should like to give you some of the sketches I have made of
      the village."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To me! give them to me?" said Dora, with wide-open eyes. "Why, Mr.
      Hetherington, I thought you wanted them to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To&mdash;what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, to remind you of this visit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps when I began them I had some notion of that kind in my head; we
      are all fools sometimes, you know. But I have changed my mind; I don't
      want to be reminded of this visit. Yes, I shall give you the sketches&mdash;that
      is to say, if you will accept them; and when I have taken my departure&mdash;and
      I shall do so soon&mdash;I shall try to forget that such a village as
      Omberley ever existed at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the people," said Dora; "of course you will try to forget the
      people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the first thing I shall try to do!"
    </p>
    <p>
      We are most of us selfish in our grief, and Walter was no exception to the
      rule. Mortified and suffering himself, it never once entered his head that
      he might be unpolite, and even rude, to another. But the knife entered
      Dora's little heart, and made her wince. She had been happy in the
      knowledge that she had met a fellow-creature who could treat her exactly
      as an equal&mdash;a man whom she could call a friend; and lo! when her
      interest is strongest, when she has been telling herself that the memory
      of the few days which he has brightened for ever will linger in her memory
      and never die, he came to tell her that his first effort would be to
      forget the place&mdash;and <i>her</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will take the pictures, if you like, Mr. Hetherington, but merely as a
      loan. You will change your mind again.. I am convinced that some day you
      will ask me for them back again, and when you do they shall certainly be
      yours. But the sketch of the cottage&mdash;is it finished already?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sketch of the cottage? Oh, I should like to keep <i>that</i>. It
      contains the picture of a lady whom I should certainly not like to
      forget."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, while the glad light danced in Dora's eyes again, he rose and took
      her hand, as he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye, Miss Greatheart. When I said I should forget the village and
      the people I was wrong. Your kindness and hospitality I shall always
      remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      So he crossed the threshold of the happy little schoolhouse, to stroll out
      again into the sunshine; and again he thought very bitterly of the woman
      who had effectually taken all the sunshine from his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He need not have thought so bitterly of her. If she had wounded him she
      was receiving her punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having left Walter in the churchyard, Edith flew home like one walking on
      air. She had accepted his decision gleefully, never attempting to alter it
      by word or look, for she was thinking all the time of the invitation she
      had received from Mr. Santley, and which had cost her such a pang to
      refuse. Walter's sudden determination left her free&mdash;free to spend a
      few hours in the company of the man who was more to her than the whole
      world. Lighthearted and happy, she hurried home, gave Walter's message to
      her aunt, and then sat down and made a very hearty meal. After it was
      over, and a reasonable time had elapsed, she again put on her hat, and
      told her aunt she was going down to the Vicarage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shan't be back till late, aunt," she added, "for, as I have to go to
      the Vicarage, I may as well walk to evening service with Miss Santley. If
      Walter changes his mind and comes, you will look after him well, won't
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Russell, promising implicit obedience, kissed her niece fondly,
      and watched her go down the road. On reaching the Vicarage, Edith was
      admitted at once. There was no necessity to take her card and keep her
      waiting while she ascertained if master or mistress was at home. She was
      known to the servants as a visitor who was always welcome&mdash;at any
      rate to the mistress of the house. So, without any preamble at all, she
      was shown into the sitting-room, and into the presence of Miss Santley.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was as luxuriously furnished as any in the Vicarage, and
      charmingly decorated with the choicest of hothouse flowers. The lady sat
      in a low wicker chair, with a book in her hand, and at her elbow a little
      gipsy table, holding a tea-service of Dresden china. The opening of the
      door disturbed the lady. She let her book fall upon her knee, and looked
      up dreamily; but the moment her eye fell upon Edith she rose, smiling
      brightly, gave the girl both her hands, and kissed her fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Edith, I am so glad!" she exclaimed; and there was a ring of
      genuine welcome in her voice. "Why, you are a perfect stranger.&mdash;Jane,
      bring a cup for Miss Dove.&mdash;Now, dear, select your chair, take off
      your hat, and make yourself comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith did as she was bidden. She placed her hat on one of the many little
      tables with which the room abounded, stood before one of the glasses for a
      moment to rectify any disarrangement of hair and costume; then she drew
      forth a little wicker chair similar to that occupied by her hostess, and
      sat down. By this time the teapot was brought in, and the tea poured, so
      Edith sat and sipped it, talking and laughing meanwhile like a happy
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, dear," said Miss Santley, "and what have you been doing with
      yourself all the week? Charles tells me you have a cousin in the village,
      who completely monopolizes you. By the way, he told me that he had tried
      to persuade you to come to tea to-day, but that you had positively
      refused. That could not have been true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it was true," returned Edith. "I did refuse when he asked me,
      because I thought I could not come. I thought my cousin would dine with us
      as usual; but I met him at church this morning, and he said he was rather
      unwell and could not come. So I thought it would not matter if I came
      after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Matter! My dear, I am delighted." And so, having thus satisfactorily
      arranged matters, the two sat chatting to their hearts' content.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very pleasant, exceedingly pleasant&mdash;at any other time Edith
      would have enjoyed it hugely; but as the hands of the bronze clock on the
      chimneypiece travelled so quickly round, she began to grow uneasy, and to
      wonder at the protracted absence of her lover. Miss Santley was a very
      pleasant person indeed, and Edith was very fond of her; but it had been a
      stronger inducement than Miss Santley that had brought her to the Vicarage
      that afternoon. Santley must know she was in the house, thought Edith; it
      was strange he did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Miss Santley glanced at the clock. In a moment she was on her
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," she exclaimed, "how the time has flown! Do you play again
      to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well walk to church together, dear," she said. "Amuse yourself by looking
      at the books, while I run away to get my bonnet and mantle on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere the lady had reached the door of the room, Edith spoke. Prolonged
      disappointment had given her courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Santley is busy, I suppose?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Santley&mdash;Charles? Oh, my dear, he's not at home!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. If he had been, do you suppose for a moment, my dear, he would have
      allowed you to be all this time in the house without coming out to say
      'How do you do'? If he had known you had been coming, of course he would
      have stayed in; but he didn't know, so immediately after afternoon service
      he went to Foxglove Manor. He wanted to see Mrs. Haldane, and he said he
      should go straight from there to the church."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Santley was near the door. The moment she had finished speaking she
      passed out of the room, and left Edith alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a pleasant task to her, this mentioning of Mrs. Haldane. She
      knew that people had already begun to speak somewhat unkindly of the
      relations between that lady and her brother. But since this was so, it was
      well that she should show to the world that she, his sister, thought
      nothing of it. Therefore she had made up her mind that, whenever it was
      necessary for her to mention that lady's name, she would do so without
      reserve of any kind. It was the only way, she thought, to prevent such
      absurd rumours from taking root.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very few minutes sufficed to make her toilet. At the end of that time
      she returned to the room where she had left Edith, to get her Prayer-book
      and the handkerchief which had fallen from her hand, and lay beside her
      chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ready, dear?" she asked brightly; then she paused, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There sat Edith, pale as a ghost, reclining in an easy-chair, with her
      head thrown back, and her forehead covered by a handkerchief soaked with
      eau-de-cologne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear!" exclaimed Miss Santley. "Whatever is the matter? Has
      anything happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, nothing," said Edith, faintly. "I have got a very bad headache, that
      is all; and&mdash;and&mdash;I cannot go to church again to-day, Miss
      Santley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to church," echoed Miss Santley. "Why, my dearest girl, of course you
      cant go to church! I will send Jane with a message to Charles, and stay
      and take care of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      But this Edith would not allow. She pulled the handkerchief from her
      forehead, and declared her intention of going home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Santley kissed her kindly. At this exhibition of tenderness Edith
      fairly broke down. She threw her arms around the lady's neck, and burst
      into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I am so sorry," she said at last, when her sobs had somewhat
      subsided; "but I could not help it. I&mdash;I am such a coward when I am
      ill!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Santley said nothing; she knew she could do nothing. There was some
      mystery here which she could not fathom, so she yielded to the girl's
      solicitations and allowed her to go home.

      CHAPTER XXII. AT THE VICARAGE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne evening about
      the middle of the week, as the Rev. Mr. Santley sat alone in his study a
      card was brought to him, on which was printed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Walter Hetherington.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman raised his brows as he read, and asked the maid, who waited
      respectfully at the door, if the gentleman had not called upon him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once before, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he state his business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did not, sir; he only said he would not detain you long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, ask the gentleman to be good enough to walk this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid retired, and a moment afterwards Walter entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men bowed to each other. One glance had assured Santley that any
      attempt at a warmer greeting would be injudicious; the other might not
      respond, and it would never do for the vicar of the parish to be snubbed
      by an itinerant painter whom nobody knew&mdash;besides, under the
      circumstances, a bow was ample greeting. He infused into it as much
      politeness as possible, welcomed his young friend to the Vicarage, and,
      pointing to a chair which he had drawn forward, begged him to be seated.
      Decidedly the clergyman was the most self-possessed of the two. For Walter
      took his seat in nervous silence; while Santley, wondering greatly in his
      own mind what could possibly have procured him the honour of that visit,
      kept the scene from flagging by that wonderful gift of small talk with
      which he was possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very pleased indeed to meet Mr. Hetherington. He had done him the
      honour to call upon him once before he thought&mdash;yes, he was sure of
      it; and he had also had the pleasure of meeting him once before, when he
      had not had the honour of his acquaintance. Was Mr. Hetherington thinking
      of making a long stay amongst them?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not very long," said Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you have made some charming sketches?" continued the clergyman.
      "There are pretty little spots about the village, spots well worthy of a
      painters brush. I used to do a little in that way myself when I was a
      youngster at college; but the vicar of a parish has onerous duties. I
      suppose at the present moment I should hardly know how to handle a brush.
      Are you thinking of leaving us soon, Mr. Hetherington?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not quite sure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! well, if you stay and would like to make use of my library, I should
      feel greatly honoured. It is the only thing I have to offer you, I fear;
      but I shall be very pleased indeed to put it at your service. It contains
      a few books on your own art, which might interest you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind, Mr. Santley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, my dear sir; I am merely neighbourly. Life would be dreary
      indeed if one could not be neighbourly in a place like this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Santley, I have come to you for your advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman, nervously dreading what was to follow, looked at his
      visitor with a calm smile, and answered pleasantly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My advice? My dear sir, I place it freely at your service, and myself
      also if I can be of the slightest use to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can be of very great use to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman merely bowed this time and waited, so Walter continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know my cousin, Miss Edith Dove?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he fixed his eyes keenly upon the clergyman's face, but the
      latter made no sign; he neither winced nor changed colour, but answered
      calmly enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the pleasure of the lady's acquaintance. She is one of the most
      esteemed members of my congregation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is about Miss Dove I wished to speak to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the clergyman bowed; again he found it unnecessary to make a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter, growing somewhat ill at ease, continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind confessing to you, Mr. Santley, that at one period of my
      career I hoped most earnestly, and indeed confidently believed, that at no
      very remote date I should have the happiness of making her my wife. I was
      sincerely attached to her; I believe she was attached to me. But recently
      all has changed. She is wasting her life; throwing aside all chance of
      happiness, through some mad infatuation about the Church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some mad infatuation about the Church!" returned the clergyman,
      methodically. "Really, my dear sir, I am afraid you forget you are
      speaking to a clergyman of the Church. As to Miss Dove, she is a lady
      whose conduct is without reproach; she is one of the Church's staunchest
      supporters!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you approve her present mode of life; you uphold it? You will not
      advise her to shake her morbid fancies away? to accept an honest affection
      and a happy home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Santley seemed to reflect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a clergyman of the Church, I should advise her the other way, I think.
      Surely the fulfilment of religious duties points to a more elevated mode
      of existence than mere marrying and giving in marriage. I am sorry for
      you, since I believe that any man possessed of that lady's esteem might
      deem himself fortunate; still, I could not advise her to act against her
      conscience and the promptings of religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And me, what do you advise me to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman shrugged his shoulders. "It seems to me that there is only
      one thing that you can do. If the lady finds your attentions disagreeable,
      surely the most honourable course for you to adopt would be to leave her&mdash;in
      peace." Walter rose, and the clergyman breathed more freely, believing
      that the interview had come to a satisfactory end. Neither of them spoke
      for a minute or so, till the clergyman looked up, and said quietly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have something more to say, Mr. Hetherington?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," 9 answered Walter; "I have something more to say." Then, going a
      few steps nearer to the clergyman, he added, "You are a hypocrite, Mr.
      Santley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman's face grew pale. He rose hastily from his seat; but before
      he could speak Walter continued, vehemently&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think I don't know you? Do you think I haven't discovered that it
      is you, and not the Church, who has taken my cousin from me? You talk to
      me of religion, of religious duties, and yet you know that you are playing
      the hypocrite to her, as you have done to me, and that you are breaking
      her heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, flushed, excited, and angry. The clergyman stood calm and very
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do well to seek this interview in my house, sir," he said. "Now you
      have insulted me with impunity, perhaps you will take your leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Walter made no attempt to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before I go," he said, "I wish to know what are your plans regarding my
      cousin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I should like to ask you, sir," returned the clergyman, "what
      authority you have for interfering in my private affairs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no authority; your private affairs are nothing to me. I speak in
      the interest of my cousin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really! I should fancy your interference would be hardly likely to do her
      much good." #
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Santley, I shall ask you one more question. Do you, or do you not,
      mean to marry my cousin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I refuse to answer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall make it my duty, before tomorrow night, to expose you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really!" returned the clergyman, with an exasperating smile. "You will
      draw your cousin's good name through the mire in order to throw a little
      mud at me. I should think, young man, you must be a treasure to your
      family. Good evening. I will ring for the servant to show you out."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he did ring&mdash;at the most opportune moment too; for Walter,
      staggered by that last thrust, perceived that his enemy was on the side of
      power. So, when in answer to her master's summons the servant appeared,
      Walter followed her; he was afraid to utter another word, for Edith's
      sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was gone, all Santley's calmness deserted him, and he walked up
      and down the room in a fit of uncontrollable rage. When he had grown
      calmer, he sat down and wrote one of his neatly worded epistles to Edith,
      making an appointment for the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He half believed that Walter had come to him, as Edith's authorized
      messenger, to attempt to force upon him those bonds which he was so very
      reluctant to wear. The clergyman could not in any other way account for
      his knowledge of the relations existing between the two. It was well for
      Edith that at that moment she was not near her lover&mdash;well for her,
      also, that no meeting could take place between them until the following
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Santley was very much more composed, and when he walked
      towards the trysting-place none would have known, from his outward
      appearance, that anything was materially wrong. He had made the
      appointment in daylight this time; since embraces could be dispensed with,
      so also could darkness and night. There was really nothing in this meeting
      after all; nothing but what might have been witnessed by a dozen pair of
      eyes. Those who did see it would see only an event of ordinary everyday
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Edith Dove, walking leisurely towards the village, was overtaken by
      the clergyman, who paused to shake hands with her, and to walk with her a
      part of the way. Had any one looked closely at these two, he would have
      seen that the clergyman, though calm, was very pale; that Edith, pale too,
      had a weary, listless look about her face; that after she had shaken hands
      with her pastor, she quickly turned away her head, for her eyes grew dim
      with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Santley saw the tears he did not care to notice them. He had found,
      directly they met, that she was suffering from one of those deplorable
      fits of temper which had more than once caused trouble between them; but
      that could not be taken any notice of now. If she chose to wear herself to
      a shadow, it was her own affair; he had something more important on hand.
      The interview could not be a long one, therefore he must reach the heart
      of the matter at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he began abruptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edith, this new course you have adopted is a dangerous one, and had
      better be abandoned without loss of time."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl raised her eyes to his face, and asked wearily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean? What have I done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you are responsible for your cousin's visit to my house; you
      must have instigated it, if you did not actually advise him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she raised her troubled eyes to his face, and said sadly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will tell you, Edith. Your cousin, a hot-headed, ill-mannered
      youth, has thought fit to take upon himself the part of protector, or
      guardian, of your happiness. In this capacity he paid me a domiciliary
      visit yesterday, and treated me to some most violent abuse. He threatened
      to make known to the public the relations between us. I advised him to
      think it over, for your sake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My cousin&mdash;Walter Hetherington, do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how does he know? how has he learned?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From you, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; it is not from me," returned Edith, whose listlessness was fast
      disappearing. "I have said nothing; I have never even mentioned your name
      to him. It must be known; it must be talked of in the village. Oh,
      Charles, spare me! Keep your promise to me, for God's sake! Any open
      disgrace would be more than I could bear. I should die."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, overcome by her emotion, had forgotten for the moment that their
      present interview was a perfectly public one. The clergyman coldly
      reminded her of the fact. Then, after she had forced upon herself a
      composure which she was far from feeling, he continued&mdash;"You had
      better understand, Edith, once and for ever, that whatever my conduct may
      be, I do not choose to have it questioned by this exceedingly officious
      young man. A repetition of the scene of yesterday I will not bear. And as
      it is evident to me that my actions are under surveillance, I must refuse
      either to see or hear from you again, until that young man has removed
      himself from the village."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles, you surely don't mean that?" exclaimed the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he certainly did mean it, and though she pleaded and argued, he
      remained firm. At last she resolved that she would speak to Walter, resent
      his interference, and, if possible, induce him to return home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the two shook hands and parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Walter dined at the-cottage. During the dinner Edith scarcely
      looked at him; while he himself was silent and distrait. But after dinner,
      when they had all retired to the drawing-room, when the old lady had
      settled down to her wool-work, and Walter had lit his cigar, Edith threw a
      light shawl over her head, and asked him if he would come with her into
      the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wondering very much at the request, Walter rose at once, and offered her
      his arm. She took it; but the moment they were alone she withdrew her hand
      and turned angrily upon him. Walter listened, and he found that he had
      some chance of being heard. He acknowledged that she had spoken the truth;
      he <i>had</i> interfered; he had deemed it quite right that he should do
      so for her sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For my sake!" returned Edith. "It seems to me there is more of
      selfishness than benevolence in what you have done. What is it to you if I
      am engaged to Mr. Santley? and if we choose to keep our engagement a
      secret, what is that to you? I am my own mistress; I can act just as I
      think fit, without the fear of coercion from any one. <i>You</i>, at any
      rate, have no right to regulate my actions or to dictate them. I suppose
      you think I have no right to marry any one, simply because I refuse to be
      coerced into marrying you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cruel thing to say; but Edith was simply dealing him, secondhand,
      some of the stabs which she herself had received from her beloved pastor
      in the morning. The stabs went deep into his heart, and the wounds
      remained for many a day. When Edith had uttered a few more truisms with
      the characteristic selfishness of love and hatred, Walter coldly suggested
      that their pleasant stroll in the garden might be brought to a
      termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned together to the house. As the old lady, beaming with delight
      at what she believed to be the sudden and happy reconciliation of the
      cousins, had prepared the tea, Walter pleased her by sitting down to take
      some before he said good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next day he returned to town.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII. DR. DUPRÉ'S ELIXIR.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>eorge Haldane
      returned home in the best of spirits. His paper had been received with
      enthusiasm by the <i>savants</i> of France, and his life in Paris had been
      one pleasant succession of visits, learned conversaziones, and private
      entertainments. Thanks to his happy pre-occupation, he scarcely noticed
      that his wife's manner was constrained, nervous, yet deeply solicitous;
      that she looked pale and worn, as if with constant watching; and that, in
      answer to his careless questioning as to affairs at home, she made only
      fragmentary replies.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering his dressing-room to change his apparel, he found Baptisto,
      who was quietly undoing his portmanteau and selecting the necessary things
      with a calm air, as if his services had never been interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, my Baptisto," he said, clapping that worthy on the shoulder, "you are
      not dead or buried, I see? Ah, you may smile, but I am quite aware of the
      trick you played me. Well, you have been the loser. You would have had a
      pleasant time of it in Paris, the best of entertainment, and nothing
      whatever to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad you have returned, senor," replied Baptisto, with his customary
      solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you have given satisfaction to your mistress during my absence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so, senor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! we shall see what report she has to make concerning you, and if
      that is favourable, I may forgive your freak of laziness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not been lazy, senor," said Baptisto, quietly preparing the
      toilette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! Pray, how have you been employing yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptisto did not reply, but smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is your inamerata and her family? I saw the little woman curtsying as
      I passed through the lodge-gates."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptisto shook his head solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, senor," he said, "you are mistaken. The woman of the lodge is a
      stupid person; and for the rest, I put no faith in women. <i>Cuerpo di
      Baccho</i>, no! They smile upon us when we are near; but no sooner do we
      turn our backs, than they smile upon some other man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty philosophy," returned Haldane, with a laugh. "Why, you are a
      downright misogynist, my Baptisto. But I don't believe one word you say,
      for all that. Men who talk like you are generally very easy conquests, and
      I would bet twenty to one on the little widow still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, senor, if all women were like your signora, it would be different.
      She is so good, so pure, so faithful at her devotions. It is a great thing
      to have religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Baptisto spoke his back was turned to his master, so that the
      extraordinary expression of his face was unnoticed, and there was no
      indication in his tone that he spoke satirically. Haldane shrugged his
      shoulders and said nothing, not caring to discuss his wife's virtues with
      a servant, however familiar. Presently he went downstairs to dinner. All
      that evening he was very affectionate and merry, talking volubly of his
      adventures in Paris, of his scientific acquaintances, and of such new
      discoveries as they had brought under his notice. In the course of his
      happy chat he spoke frequently of a new acquaintance, one Dr. Dupré, whom
      he had met in the French capital. "The French, however far behind the
      Germans in speculative affairs," he observed, "are far their superiors,
      and ours, in physiology. Take this Dupré, for example. He is a wonderful
      fellow! His dissections and vivisections' have brought him to such a point
      of mastery that he is almost certain that he has discovered the problem
      poor Lewes broke his heart over&mdash;how and by what mechanism we can't
      think. I don't quite believe he has succeeded in that great discovery, but
      some of his minor discoveries are extraordinary. Did you read the account
      in the papers of his elixir of death?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen shook her head. The very name seemed horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His elixir of death?" she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. A chemical preparation, the fundamental principle of which is
      morphine. By its agency he can so produce in a living organism the
      ordinary phenomena of death, that even <i>rigor mortis</i> is simulated. I
      saw the experiment tried on two rabbits, a Newfoundland dog, and, to crown
      all, on the human subject. They were all, to every appearance, dead; the
      rabbits for twenty-four hours, the dog for half a day, and the woman for
      an hour and a half."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horrible!" exclaimed Ellen, with a shudder. "Do you actually mean he
      experimented on a living woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; on a strapping wench, the daughter of his housekeeper; and a very
      fine thing she made of it. We subscribed together, and presented her with
      a purse of a thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think such things are wicked," cried Ellen, with some warmth. "Mere
      mortals have no right to play, in that way, with the mystery of life and
      death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Nell," cried Haldane, laughing, "it is in the interests of
      science!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I am sure it is not right. Life is given and taken by God alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your argument, if accepted, would make all mankind accept the religion of
      the Peculiar People, who will cure no diseases by human intervention. As
      to this business of suspended animation, it is merely a part of our
      discoveries in anodynes. Dupré's experiment, I know, is perfectly safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that is not the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I mean is, that death is too solemn and awful a thing to imitate as
      you describe. Such experiments are simply blasphemous, in my opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come," cried the philosopher. "There is no blasphemy where there is
      no irreverence. According to your religious people, your priests of the
      churches, there was blasphemy in circumnavigating the globe; in
      discovering the circulation of the blood; in ascertaining the age of the
      earth; and, still later, in using chloroform to lessen the pangs of
      parturition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what purpose can be served by such experiments as <i>that?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good many," was the reply. "For example, it may help us to the
      discovery of the nature of life itself, which has puzzled everybody, from
      Parmenides down to Haeckel. If we can by a simple anodyne suspend the
      vital mechanism for a period, and then by a vegetable antidote restore it
      again to action, the resurrection of Lazarus will cease to be a miracle,
      and the pretensions of Christianity&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen rose impatiently, with an expression of sincere pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Nell, what is the matter?" cried her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot bear to hear you discuss such a thing. Oh, George, if you would
      leave such wicked speculations alone, and try to believe in the mystery
      and sovereignty of God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean, burn my books, and go to hear your seraphic friend every
      Sunday?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he not touched, unconsciously, on another painful chord? Why,
      otherwise, did his wife flush scarlet and partially avert her face?
      Conquering herself with an effort, she went over to him, and bending over
      him, looked fondly into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are so much cleverer than I, so much wiser, and do you think I am not
      proud of your wisdom? But, all the same, dear, I wish you did not think as
      you do. When life becomes a mere experiment, a mere thing of mechanism,
      what will be left? If we knew everything, even what we are, and why we
      exist, the world would be a tomb&mdash;with no place in it for the Living
      God."
    </p>
    <p>
      Touched by her manner, Haldane drew her down by his side and kissed her;
      then, with more earnestness than he had yet exhibited, he answered her,
      holding her hand in his own and pressing it softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Nell, do me the justice to believe that I am not quite a
      materialist; simple agnosticism is the very converse of materialism. There
      is not living a scientific philosopher of any eminence who does not, in
      his calculations, postulate a mystery which can never be solved by the
      finest intellect. Even if we had fully completed, with the poet&mdash;=
    </p>
    <p>
      ```'The new creed of science, which showeth to man
    </p>
    <p>
      `````How he darkly began,
    </p>
    <p>
      ```How he grew from a cell to a soul, without plan;
    </p>
    <p>
      ```How he breaks like a wave of the ocean, and goes
    </p>
    <p>
      `````To eternal repose&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ```A tone that must fade, tho' the great Music grows! '=
    </p>
    <p>
      even then, we should know nothing of the First Cause. That must for ever
      remain inscrutable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how horrible it would be to believe in annihilation? <i>Can</i> you
      believe in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," replied the philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellens face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am so glad to hear you say that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Nell, annihilation is absurd."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, isn't it?" she cried triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is refuted, on the face of it, by the doctrine of the conservation of
      force. Life is eternal, in one shape or another; no force can be
      destroyed, be sure of that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish Mr. Santley could hear you! He wouldn't call you an atheist then!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane's face darkened angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Does the man actually&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't misunderstand," cried Ellen, flushing scarlet. "I do not mean that
      he really calls you an atheist, but he is so sorry, so deeply sorry, that
      you do not believe. He does not know you, dear, and takes all my bear's
      satirical growling for solemn earnest. Now, when I tell him&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will tell him nothing," exclaimed Haldane, with sudden sternness. "I
      will have no priest coming between my wife and me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Santley would never do that," she returned, now trembling violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Santley is like all his tribe, I suppose&mdash;a meddler and a
      mischief-maker. That is the worst of other-worldliness; it gives these
      traders in the Godhead, these peddlers who would give us in exchange for
      belief in their superstitions a <i>bonus</i> in paradise, an excuse for
      making this world unbearable. Well, my atheism, if you choose to call it
      so, against his theism. Mine at least keeps me a man among men, while his
      keeps him a twaddler among women."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane spoke with heat, for the word "atheist" had somehow stung him to
      the quick. This man, who rejected all outward forms of belief, and whose
      conversation was habitually ironical, was in his inmost nature deeply and
      sincerely religious; humbly reverent before the forces of nature;
      spiritually conscious of that Power beyond ourselves which makes for
      righteousness. True, he rejected the ordinary forms of theism; but he had,
      on the other hand, a deep though dumb reverence for the character of
      Christ, and he had no sympathy with such out-and-out materialists as
      Haeckel and <i>hoc genus omne</i>. For the rest, he was liberal-minded,
      and had no desire to interfere with his wife's convictions; could smile a
      little at her simplicity, and would see no harm in her clerical
      predispositions, so long as the clergyman didn't encroach too far on the
      domain of married life and domestic privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His indignation did not last. Seeing his wife greatly agitated, and
      fearing that he had caused her pain, he drew her forehead down and kissed
      it; then, patting her cheek, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, Nell. I did not mean to scold; but one does not like hard
      names. When any one calls me 'atheist,' I am like the old woman whom
      Cobbett called a 'parallelogram;' it is not the significance of the
      epithet, but its opprobrium, that rouses me. Besides, I do not like any
      man to abuse me&mdash;to my own wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one does that," she cried. "You know I would not listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope not, my dear." He added after a little, looking at her
      thoughtfully and sadly, "Man and wife have fallen asunder before now, on
      this very question of religion. Well, rather than that should happen, I
      will let you convert me. Will that satisfy you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never be quite satisfied till I know that you believe as I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That there is a just God, who made and cherishes us; and that, through
      the blood of His Son we shall live again although we die!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is a beautiful creed, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? I will go with you thus far. I believe that, if there is a God,
      He is just, and that we shall certainly live again, if it is for our
      good."
    </p>
    <p>
      The emphasis with which he spoke the last words attracted her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For our good?" she queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quoting the saddest words ever written, by the saddest and best man
      I ever knew. * He, too, believed that a God might spare us, and give us
      eternal life, if&mdash;mark the proviso&mdash;eternal life were indeed <i>for
      our good.</i> But suppose the contrary&mdash;suppose God knew better, and
      that it would be an evil and unhappy gift? Alas! who knows?"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     *  J. S. Mill.
</pre>
    <p>
      He rose from his chair, still encircling his wife's waist, and moved
      towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to the drawing-room," he cried gaily. "After so much offhand
      theology, a little music will be delightful. Ah, Nell, one breath of
      Beethoven is worth all the prosings of your parsons. Play to me, and,
      while the music lasts, I will believe what you will."

      CHAPTER XXIV. THE EXPERIMENT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next morning
      Haldane was busy in his laboratory. When he came in to lunch, looking
      disreputable enough in his old coat, and smelling strongly of tobacco, he
      said to his wife&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "By-the-by, Nell, do you remember what I told you last night about Dupré's
      wonderful elixir? I forgot to tell you that I have brought some of it with
      me, for purposes of private experiment." Ellen looked horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be afraid," he continued, laughing; "your cats and dogs are safe
      from me. I have found a better subject, and mean to operate on him this
      very afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a sort of penance for his shamming illness, I shall kill Baptisto."
    </p>
    <p>
      She uttered a cry, and raised her hands in protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For heavens sake, George, be warned! If you have any of that horrible
      stuff, throw it away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my dear Nell," said the philosopher, "be reasonable; there is not
      the slightest cause for alarm. You will see this experiment, and it will,
      I hope, treble your faith in miracles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will <i>not</i> see it. I beseech you, abandon the idea. As for
      Baptisto&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the Spaniard entered the room, carrying certain dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been telling your mistress, Baptisto, that you are ready to be a
      martyr to science. At four o'clock precisely, you will be a dead man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptisto bowed solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite ready, senor."
    </p>
    <p>
      But here Ellen interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is ridiculous; your master is only joking. He would not do anything so
      foolish, so wicked. As for you, I forbid you to encourage him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptisto bowed again, with a curious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is for the senor to command. As he knows, he has saved my life, and he
      may take it whenever he pleases."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane nodded, in the act of drinking a glass of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be afraid, Baptisto. After death, there is the resurrection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, senor, is your affair," returned the Spaniard, phlegmatically,
      shrugging his shoulders. "You will do with me as you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      And so saying, he glided from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen again and again entreated her husband not to proceed in his
      experiment; but he had long made up his mind that it was perfectly safe,
      and he could not be persuaded. To her gentle: spirit, the whole idea
      seemed horrible in the extreme; but her greatest dread was that it might
      be attended with danger to the subject. Haldane, however, assured her that
      this was impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the afternoon Haldane and Baptisto were together in the laboratory. A
      little after four o'clock, as Ellen was walking on the terrace, Haldane
      came to her, smiling and holding up a small vial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all over," he said, "and the experiment is quite successful. Come
      and see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not quite understanding him, she suffered him to lead her into the
      laboratory; but, on crossing the threshold, she uttered a cry of horror.
      Stretched on a sofa, lay Baptisto, moveless, and, to all seeming, without
      one breath of life. His eyes were wide open, but rayless; his jaw fixed,
      his face pale as grey marble; a peaceful smile, as of death itself, upon
      his handsome face. The light of the sun, just sinking towards the west,
      streamed in through the high window upon the apparently lifeless form. In
      the chamber itself there was a sickly smell, like that of some suffocating
      vapour. The whole scene would have startled and appalled even a strong
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, George!" cried the lady, clasping her hands. "What have you done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be alarmed," was the reply, "Its all right!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you said the experiment&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was successful? Perfectly. There lies our poor friend, comfortably
      finished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But are you sure, quite sure, that he is not dead? He is not breathing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not. The simulation is perfect. Place your hand on his wrist&mdash;you
      will detect no pulse. Turn his pupils to the light&mdash;you see, they do
      not contract. The case would deceive a whole college of physicians."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he suited the action to the word&mdash;placed his finger upon
      the pulse, gazed at the glazing pupils; raised one of the lifeless arms,
      which, on being released, fell heavily as lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horrible, horrible! For God's sake, recover him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All in good time. He has only been dead a quarter of an hour; in half an
      hour precisely I shall say, 'Arise and walk.' Feel his forehead, Nell; it
      is as cold as marble."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ellen drew back, shuddering, and could not be persuaded to touch the
      sleeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go back to your promenade. I will call you when he is awakened."
      Sick and terrified, Ellen obeyed her husband. Standing on the terrace, she
      waited for his summons; and at last it came. Haldane appeared, and
      beckoned; she followed him to the laboratory, and there, seated in an
      armchair, comfortably sipping a glass of wine, was the Spaniard&mdash;a
      little pale still, but otherwise not the worse for his state of coma.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God!" cried Ellen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought he would never recover. But it must have been a horrible
      experience."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptisto smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell the signora all about it," said his master. "Did you feel any pain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None, senor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What were your sensations? Pleasant or otherwise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite pleasant, senor. It was like sinking into an agreeable sleep. If
      death is like that, it is a bagatelle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you at all conscious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not of this world, senor, but I had bright dreams of another. I thought I
      was in paradise, walking in the sunshine&mdash;ah, so bright! I was sorry,
      senor, when I came back to this world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hear!" cried Haldane, turning to his wife. "After all, death itself
      may be a glorious experience; for 'in that sleep of death what dreams may
      come!' It is quite clear at least that all the phenomena of death, such as
      we shrink from and shudder at, may be accompanied by some kind of pleasant
      psychic consciousness. Bravo, Baptisto! After this, we shall call you
      Lazarus the second. You have passed beyond the shadow of the sepulchre,
      and returned to tell the tale."
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the resuscitation, Ellen still revolted from the whole proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you are satisfied," she said, "promise me never to use that dreadful
      elixir again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you may make your mind easy. The experiment is an ugly one, I
      admit, and I am not anxious to repeat it&mdash;at least, not on the human
      organism. For the same reason, my dear Nell, pray keep the affair to
      yourself, and make no confidences, even to your confessor&mdash;I should
      say, your clergyman, Will you promise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly. I should not like any one to know you did such things. As
      for Mr. Santley, he would be shocked beyond measure."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she left the two men together. In the mean time, Baptisto
      had-finished his wine and risen to his feet. While his master regarded him
      with an approving smile, he walked over to the door, softly closed it, and
      returning noiselessly across the room, said in a low voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is something, senor, I did not tell you. I had dreams."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you said, my Baptisto."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah yes, but not all. While I was lying there, I thought that <i>you</i>
      were the dead man, and that the senora, your widow, had married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The English priest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane started, and looked in amazement at the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the devil do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, senor, it was only my dream; a foolish dream. You were lying in your
      winding-sheet, and they were kneeling at the altar&mdash;smiling, senor. I
      did not like to speak of it to the senora; but it was very strange."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane forced a laugh, while, with a mysterious look, Baptisto crept from
      the chamber. Was it in sheer simplicity or in deep cunning that the
      Spaniard had spoken, touching so delicate a chord? Left alone, Haldane
      paced up and down the laboratory in agitation. He was not by temperament a
      jealous or a suspicious man, but he was troubled in spite of himself. The
      words sounded like a warning, almost an insinuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could the fellow mean?" he asked himself again and again. "Could he
      possibly have dreamed <i>that?</i> No; it is preposterous. There was
      malice in his eye, and mischief.... Ellen married to Santley! Bah! what am
      I thinking about? The fellow is not a <i>prophet!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner, whether in innocence or for some set purpose of his own,
      Baptisto contrived to poison all the sweetness of that successful
      experiment. When Haldane again joined his wife that evening, he was
      taciturn, distraught, nervous, and irritable. All his buoyancy had
      departed. Ellen saw the change, and puzzled herself to account for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She played to him, sang to him, but failed to drive the cloud from his
      brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had retired for the night, he still sat pondering over Baptisto's
      words.

      CHAPTER XXV. "BEWARE, MY LORD, OF JEALOUSY!"
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f Baptisto's
      object in describing a dream so ominous was to attract his master's
      attention to the intimate relations between Mrs. Haldane and the
      clergyman, he certainly succeeded. Once assured in this direction,
      Haldane's perceptions were keen enough. He noticed that the mere mention
      of Santley's name filled Ellen with a sort of nervous constraint; that,
      although the clergyman's visits were frequent, they were generally made at
      times when Haldane himself was busy and preoccupied&mdash;that is to say,
      during his well-known hours of work; and that, moreover, Santley, however
      much he liked the society of the lady, invariably avoided the husband, or,
      if they met, contrived to frame some excuse for speedy parting. Now,
      Haldane trusted his wife implicitly, and believed her incapable of any
      infidelity, even in thought. Still, he did not quite like the aspect of
      affairs. Much as he trusted his wife, he had a strong moral distrust for
      anything in the shape of a priest; and he determined, therefore, to keep
      his eyes upon the clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after that curious physiological experiment, he had the
      following conversation with Baptisto. It was the first day of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baptisto, I thought you were a good Catholic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I am, senor," returned the Spaniard, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet you went to an English church-yesterday, I hear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, senor. I go there very often."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simply out of curiosity. Mr. Santley is a beautiful preacher, and has a
      silvery voice. While you were away, I went once, twice, three times. There
      is a young senora there who plays sweetly upon the great organ; I like to
      listen, to-watch the congregation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! By-the-bye, Baptisto, I have been thinking over the dream of
      yours, when&mdash;when you were lying there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, senor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray, what put such a foolish idea in your head?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell, senor; all I know is, it came. A foolish dream, do you
      say? I suppose it is because the clergyman was here so often, when you
      were away. And madame is so devout! I trust, senor, my dream has not given
      you offence; perhaps I was wrong to speak of it at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldanes face had gone black as a thunder-cloud. Placing his hand on the
      other's shoulder, and looking firmly into his face, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, Baptisto."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am listening, senor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I thought you would come back to life to tell lies about your
      mistress, I would have let you lie the other day and rot like a dead dog,
      rather than have recovered you at all. You hear? Take care! I know you do
      not love your mistress, but if you dare to whisper one word against her, I
      will drive you for ever from my door."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptisto bowed his head respectfully before the storm, but retained his
      usual composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Senor, may I speak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but again, take care!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should not blame me if I am jealous for your honour!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane started, and uttered an expletive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My honour, you dog? What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This, senor. I would rather die than give you offence; and as for the
      senora, I love her also, for is she not your wife? But will you be angry
      still, when I tell you, when I warn you, to beware of that man, that
      priest? He is a bad man, very bad. Ah, I have watched&mdash;and seen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you seen?" cried Haldane, clutching him by the arm. "Come, out
      with it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough to show me that he is not your friend&mdash;that he is dangerous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! is that all? Now, listen to me, and be sure I mean what I say. I
      will have no servant of mine spying upon my wife. I will have no servant
      of mine insinuating that my honour is in danger. If I hear another word of
      this, if you convey to me by one look the fact that you are still prying,
      spying, and suspecting, I shall take you by the collar and send you flying
      out of my house. Now, go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptisto, who knew his master's temper perfectly, bowed and withdrew. He
      had no wish to say one word more. He had thrown out a dark hint, a black
      seed of suspicion, and he knew that he might safely let it work. It did
      work, rapidly and terribly. Left alone, Haldane became a prey to the
      wildest fears and suspicions. He remembered now that his wife had been
      acquainted with this man in her girlhood; that there had even been some
      passage of love between them. He remembered how eagerly she had renewed
      the acquaintance, and with what admiring zeal the clergyman had responded.
      He pictured to himself the sympathetic companionship, the zealous
      meetings, the daily religious intercourse, of these two young people, each
      full of the fervour of a blind superstition. Could it be possible that
      they loved each other? Questioning his memory, he recalled looks, words,
      tones, which, although scarcely noticed at the time, seemed now of painful
      significance. The mere thought was sickening. Already he realized the
      terrible phrase-of the poet Young&mdash;"the jealous are the damned."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane was not habitually a violent man. Though passionate and headstrong
      by temperament, he had schooled himself to gentleness after a stormy
      youth, and the chilly waters of philosophy, at which he drank daily, kept
      his head cool and his pulses calm. But the stormy spirit, though hushed,
      was not altogether dead within him, and under his habitual reticence and
      good-humoured cynicism, there lay the most passionate idolatry for his
      beautiful wife. He had set her up in his heart of hearts, with a faith too
      perfect for much expression; and it had not occurred to him, in his
      remotest dreams, that any other man could ever come between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, suddenly as a lightning flash illumining a dark landscape, the
      fear came upon him that perhaps he had been unwary and unwise. Was it
      possible, he asked himself, that he had' been too studious and too
      book-loving, too reticent also in all those little attentions which by
      women, who always love sweetmeats, are so tenderly prized? Moreover, he
      was ten years his wife's, elder&mdash;was that disparity of years also a
      barrier between their souls? No; he was sure it was not. He was sure that
      she was not hypocritical, and that she loved him. Wherever the blame might
      be, if blame there were, it was certainly not hers. She had been in all
      respects, a tender and a sympathetic wife; encouraging his deep study of
      science, even when she most distrusted its results; proud of his
      attainments, and eager for his success; in short, a perfect helpmate, but
      for her old-fashioned prejudices in the sphere of religion. Ah, <i>religion!</i>
      There was the one word which solved the enigma, and aroused in our
      philosopher's bosom that fierce indignation which long ago led Lucretius
      into such passionate hate against the Phantom,=
    </p>
    <p>
      ```"Which with horrid head
    </p>
    <p>
      ```Leered hideously from all the gates of heaven!"=
    </p>
    <p>
      It needed only this to complete his loathing for the popular theology, for
      all its teachers. Yes, he reflected, religion only was to blame. In its
      name, his wife's sympathies had been tampered with, her spirit more or
      less turned against himself; in its name, his house had been secretly
      invaded, his domestic happiness poisoned, his peace of mind destroyed. It
      was the old story! Wherever this shadow of superstition crawled, craft and
      dissimulation began. Now, as in the beginning, it came between father and
      child, sister and brother, man and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that when George Haldane came forth from having his dark
      hour alone, he rather avoided meeting his wife at once, and, taking his
      hat, stepped out from the laboratory on to the shrubbery path. He had
      scarcely done so, when his eye fell upon two figures standing together in
      the distance, upon the terrace of the house. One was Mrs. Haldane, wearing
      her garden hat and a loose shawl thrown over her shoulders. The other was
      the clergyman of the parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane drew back, and watched. In that moment he knew the extent of his
      humiliation; for never before had he been a spy upon his wife's actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their backs were towards him. Santley was talking eagerly; Ellen was
      looking down. Presently they began to move slowly along the terrace, side
      by side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane watched them gloomily. The sunlight fell brightly upon them, and
      on the old Manor house, with its brilliant creepers and glittering panes,
      while the old chapel, with the watcher in its ruined porch, remained in
      shadow. It seemed like an omen. In the darkness of his hiding-place,
      Haldane felt satanic. Yes, there they walked&mdash;children of God, as
      they called themselves&mdash;in God's sunlight; and he, the searcher for
      light, the unbeliever, was forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Santley paused again, and, with an impassioned gesture, pointed
      upward. Ellen raised her head, and looked upward too, listening eagerly to
      his words. Haldane laughed fiercely to himself, with all the ugliness of
      his jealousy upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they disappeared into the house. A little afterwards Santley
      emerged from the front door, and came walking rapidly down the avenue. His
      manner was eager and happy, almost jubilant, and Haldane saw, when he
      approached, that his face looked positively radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was passing, when Haldane stepped out and confronted him. He started,
      paused, and a shadow fell instantaneously upon his handsome face.
      Recovering himself, he held out his hand. Haldane did not seem to see the
      gesture, but, nodding a careless greeting, said, with his habitual <i>sang
      froid</i>&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well met, Mr. Santley. Here I am again, you see, hard at work. Have you
      come from the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," answered Santley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On some new message of Christian charity and beneficence, I suppose? Ah,
      my dear sir, you are indefatigable. And the old women of the parish must
      indeed find you a Good Shepherd. Did you find my wife at home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And zealous, as usual, I suppose?' Ah, what a thing it is to be pious!
      But let me beg you not to encourage her too much. Charity begins at home;
      and what with soup-kitchens, offertories, subscriptions for church
      repairs, and societies for the gratuitous distribution of flannel
      waistcoats, I am in a fair way of being ruined."
    </p>
    <p>
      Santley forced a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be afraid. My errand to-day was not a begging one, I assure you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to hear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was merely bringing Mrs. Haldane a book I promised to lend her. To tell
      the truth, she finds your library rather destitute of works of a religious
      nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really think so?" exclaimed Haldane, drily. "Why, I thought it
      unusually well provided in that respect. Let me see! There are Volney's
      'Ruins of Empire,' Monboddo's 'Dissertations,' Drummond's 'Academical
      Questions,' excellent translations of Schopenhauer and Hartmann, not to
      speak of thirty-six volumes of Diderot, and fifty of Arouet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Santley opened his eyes in horror and astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arouet!" he ejaculated. "Do you actually mean to call Voltaire a
      religious writer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Highly so. There is religion even in 'La Pucelle,' but it reaches its
      culmination in the 'Philosophical Dictionary.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you would actually let Mrs. Haldane read such works as those?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; though, am sorry to say, she prefers 'The Old Helmet' and the
      'Heir of Redclyffe.' May I ask the name of the work you have been good
      enough to lend her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a book from which I myself have received great benefit&mdash;Père
      Hyacinthes 'Sermons.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Père Hyacinthe?" repeated Haldane. "Ah! the jolly priest who reverenced
      celibacy, and proclaimed himself the father of a strapping boy. Well, the
      man was at least honest. I think all clergymen should marry, and at as
      early an age as possible. What is your opinion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Santley flushed to the temples, while Haldane watched him with a gloomy
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think&mdash;I am sure," he stammered, "that the married state is the
      happiest&mdash;perhaps the holiest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With these sentiments, of which I cordially approve, why the deuce are
      you a bachelor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The clergyman winced at the question, and his colour deepened; then, as if
      musing, he glanced round towards the house&mdash;a look which was observed
      and fully appreciated by his tormentor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure my wife would encourage you to change your condition. Like most
      women, she is by instinct a matchmaker."
    </p>
    <p>
      Santley did not seem to hear; at any rate, he made no reply, but, holding
      out his hand quickly, exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must go now. I am rather in haste."
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane did not take the hand, but put his arm upon the clergyman's
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, good day," he said. "Take my advice, though, and get a sensible
      wife as soon as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      Santley tried to smile, but only succeeded in looking more pale and
      nervous than usual. With a few murmured words of adieu, he moved rapidly
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haldane watched him thoughtfully until he disappeared down the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if that man can smile?" he said to himself. "No; I am afraid he
      is too horribly in earnest. I suppose, the women would call him handsome&mdash;<i>spiritual</i>;
      but I hate such pallid, waxen-featured, handsome dolls. A pretty shepherd,
      that, for a Christian flock to follow; a fellow who makes his very
      ignorance of this world constitute his claim to act as cicerone to the
      next. Fancy being jealous, actually <i>jealous</i>, of such a thing as
      that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned back into his laboratory and tried to dismiss Baptisto's
      suggestion from his mind; but it was impossible. He could not disguise
      from himself that Santley, with his seraphic face and sad, earnest eyes,
      was the kind of creature whom the weaker sex adore, and that he was
      rendered doubly dangerous to women by the radiant mesmerism of a
      fascinating and voluptuous celestial superstition.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. FIRST LEAVES FROM A PHILOSOPHER NOTE-BOOK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> am about to set
      down, in as concise a manner as possible, and at present solely for my
      private edification (some day, perhaps, another eye may read the lines,
      but not yet), certain events which have lately influenced my domestic
      life. Were it not that even a professed scientist might decline to publish
      experiments affecting his own private happiness, the description of the
      events to which I allude might almost form a chapter in my slowly
      progressing "Physiology of Ethics," and the description would be at least
      as interesting as many of Ferriers accounts of vivisection on dumb
      animals. But, unfortunately, I am unable, in this case, to apply the
      dissecting knife to my neighbours heart, without laying bare the ugly
      wound in my own.
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin then, I, George Haldane, recluse, pessimist, moral physiologist,
      and would-be moral philosopher, have discovered, at forty years of age,
      that I am capable of the most miserable of all human passions; worse, that
      this said ignoble passion of jealousy has a certain rational foundation.
      For ten years I have been happy with a wife who seemed the perfection of
      human gentleness and beauty; who, although unfortunately we have been
      blest with no offspring, has shown the tenderest solicitude and sympathy
      for the children of my brain; and who, in her wifely faith and sanctity,
      seemed to be the sole link still holding me to a church whose history has
      always filled me with abhorrence, and a religion whose infantine theology
      I despise. Well, <i>nous avons changé tout cela</i>. My mind is no longer
      peaceful, my hearth no longer sacred; and the woman I love seems slowly
      drifting from me on a stream of sensuous spiritualism&mdash;another name
      for a religious rehabilitation of the flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any other man were the victim, I should think the situation highly
      absurd. Here, on the one hand, is a fanatical Protestant priest, with the
      face of a seraphic monk, the experience of a schoolgirl, and the <i>gaucherie</i>
      of a country chorister who has never grown a beard; a fellow whose sole
      claims to notice are his white hands, his clean linen, and his function as
      a silly shepherd; a man fresh from college, ignorant of the world. Here,
      on the other hand, am I, physically and intellectually his master, knowing
      almost every creed beneath the sun, and the slave of none; indifferent to
      vulgar human passions, and disposed to disintegrate them one and all with
      the electric current of a negative philosophy. Between us both, trembling
      this way and that, is that fair thing of flesh and blood, my wife, zealous
      to save her own soul alive, and fearful at times, I fancy, that I have
      sold mine to the Prince of Darkness. It is another version of science
      against superstition, common sense against a lie; and Ellen Haldane is the
      prize. A fiery Spaniard, like Baptisto yonder, would end the affair with a
      stiletto-thrust; but I, of colder blood, am not likely to do anything so
      courageous or so foolish, but am content to watch and watch, and to feel
      the sick contamination of my suspicion creeping over me like an
      unwholesome mildew. A stiletto thrust? Why, the mere tongue, a less fatal
      weapon, would do it all. If I could only summon up the courage to say to
      my wife, "I know your secret; choose between this man and me, between his
      creed and mine, between your duty as a wife and your zeal as a Christian,"
      I fancy there would be an end to it all. But I am too timorous; I suppose,
      too ashamed of my suspicions, too proud to acknowledge so contemptible a
      rival. As a Spaniard covers his face with his mantle, I veil my soul with
      my pride; and, under the mantle of unsuspicion, rest irresolute, while the
      thing grows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice, I have thought of another way&mdash;of taking my wife by
      the hand and saying, "To-morrow, my dear, we shall leave this place, and
      return to Spain or Italy&mdash;some quiet place abroad." I could easily
      find an excuse for the migration, which, once effected, would make an end
      of the affair. But that, in my opinion, would be too cowardly. It would,
      indeed, be an admission that the danger was real and imminent; that, in
      other words, the fight for honour could only be saved by an ignominious
      retreat. No; Ellen Haldane must take her chance. If she is not strong
      enough to hold out against evil, then let her go&mdash;<i>au bon Dieu</i>
      or <i>au bon diable</i>, as either leads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet what am I saying? It is precisely because I have the utmost faith in
      her purity of heart that I watch the struggle with a certain patience. I
      believe there will be a victim, but not my Ellen. Surely, if there is a
      good woman in the world, she is that woman. As for the other, every day,
      every hour, brings the cackling creature further and further into my
      decoy. Even if he tried to turn back now, I do not think I should let him.
      No; let him swim in and on, and in and on, till he reaches the place where
      I, like the decoy man, can catch him fluttering, and&mdash;wring his neck?
      Perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite clear that the man takes me for an idiot. At first he used
      precautions, invented subterfuges; latterly, certain of my stupidity or
      indifference, he comes and goes without disguise. When I meet him driving
      side by side of my wife in the phaeton, on some pretended errand of mercy,
      he gives me a careless bow, a nod. As he goes by my den, on his way to
      invite her out to visit his sister or his church, he makes no excuse, but
      passes jauntily, with a conversational pat for the stupid watch-dog: that
      is all. It would be amusing, I say, if it were not almost insufferable.
    </p>
    <p>
      This afternoon, as Ellen was going out, I blankly suggested that she
      should stay at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you are busy," she said&mdash;"always busy with your books and
      experiments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not too busy, my dear Nell, for a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with you. Where are
      you going? To the Vicarage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To see the parson, or his sister?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both. We have a great deal to discuss, about the designs for the new
      stained-glass windows, which have just come from London."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very interesting; but they will keep for a day. I fancy I could show you
      something quite as interesting, in my laboratory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hate the laboratory," she cried, "and those horrible experiments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you should not hate what your husband loves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mean that I hate them, quite; but I think them so useless!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More useless than stained-glass windows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is certainly not useless to beautify the House of God. Oh, I do so
      wish you could feel as I do about these things! What is the world without
      them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without stained-glass windows?" I suggested sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "George, why have you such a dislike for religion? Why do you hate
      everything I love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, my dear Nell, it was <i>you</i>, not I, that spoke of hating.
      Philosophers never hate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you do worse; you despise it. Thank God we have no children. It would
      be horrible to tell them that their father forbade them to go to church,
      or pray!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a stab into my heart of hearts, that cry of thanks to God.
      Despite myself, I lost my composure. She saw it instantly, and in the
      manner of her sex, encroached.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, George, do try to think sometimes of these things, for my sake! You
      would be so much happier, you surely would have so much more blessing, if
      you sometimes prayed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know that I do not pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you do not believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not believe precisely as your priest believes, that is all."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at me eagerly; then, after a moments hesitation, cried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "George, if I asked a favour, would you grant it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let Mr. Santley come sometimes, and speak with you about God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was too much, almost, for even me to bear with equanimity. I am
      afraid I did not look particularly amiable as I answered, sharp and short,
      turning from her&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, I think you had better go and look at those designs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, you are angry again!" she cried; and I knew by the sound of her
      voice that her throat was choked with tears. "You are always angry when I
      touch upon religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were not talking of religion," I retorted; "you were talking of that
      man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you dislike him so? Because he is a preacher of the Word?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he is a canting hypocrite, like all his tribe," I cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that I had lost my temper, as was inevitable, and, sighing deeply,
      moved to the door. I followed her with my eyes. I would have given the
      world to call her back; to clasp her in my arms; to tell her my aching
      fears; to promise her I would worship any God she choose, in any place, in
      any way, so long as she would only be true, and answer my eager impulse
      with a little love. But I was too proud for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you are going?" I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned, looking at me very sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if you do not mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      I shrugged my shoulders, and after another sad, reproachful look, she left
      the room. A minute afterwards, she drove her ponies past the window,
      without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Thursday, September</i> 15.&mdash;A golden autumn day, so warm and
      still that it reminded me of the Indian summer. Not a leaf stirred, but
      the insects in the air were like floating blossoms, and seemed to sleep
      upon their wings. Even all round my den the shadows were sultry, and
      intertangled with slumberous shafts of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fine weather rather disappointed me, for I had arranged for a day's
      recreation. In my youth, before I was caught myself in the tedious snares
      of speculation, I used to be an ardent fisherman, and I still retain
      sufficient knowledge of the gentle craft to cast a fly tolerably. So,
      tired of work, and a little weary of my own thoughts, I determined, for
      the first time, to take advantage of the permission my neighbour, Lord
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, has given me, and spend a day upon the river
      banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the sunshine, and the absence of even a breath of wind, I
      shouldered my basket, lifted my rod, and set off. Ellen was already out
      and about; so I did not see her before I started. Taking a short cut
      through the shrubberies, I soon came to the banks of the Emmet&mdash;as
      pretty a little stream as ever rippled over golden sands, or reached out
      an azure arm to turn some merry watermill. Arrived there, I soon saw that
      it would be useless to try a cast till there was a little wind; so,
      without putting my rod together, I strolled on along the river-side, till
      I was several miles away from the Manor house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stream was rather low, but here and there were good deep pools, but so
      calm, so sunny, that every overhanging tree, every finger of fern, every
      blade of grass, was reflected in them as in a mirror. Still, as the time
      was, the waters were full of life. Over the pools hung clusters of flies
      like glittering spiders' webs, scarcely moving in the sunshine; and when,
      from time to time, a trout rose, he leaped a full foot into the golden air
      above him, and sank back to coolness beneath an ever-widening ring of
      light. Sometimes from the grassy edge of the bank a water-rat would slip,
      swimming rapidly across, with his nose just lifted above the water, and
      his tail leaving a thin, bright trail. Water-ouzels rose at every curve,
      following swiftly the winding of the stream; and twice past my feet
      flashed a kingfisher, like an azure ray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way lay sometimes through deep grassy meadows, sometimes by the sides
      of corn-fields where the sheaves were already slanted, oftentimes through
      thick shrubberies and woods already yellow with the withering leaf. From
      time to time I passed a farm, with orchards sloping down to the very
      water's edge, or pastures slanting down to shallows where the cattle
      waded, breaking the water to silver streaks and whisking their tails
      against the clustering swarms of gnats. It was very pleasant and very
      still, but, from a fishing point of view, exceedingly absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by, however, a faint breeze began to touch the pools, and putting
      my rod together, and selecting my finest casting-line and two tiny flies,
      I tried a cast. Fortunately the wind was blowing sunward, and as I faced
      the light, the shadow fell behind me; but, nevertheless, the shadow of my
      rod flitted about at every cast, and threatened to spoil my sport. My
      first catch was an innocent baby-fish as big as my thumb, who came at the
      fly with a rush, and fought desperately when hooked. When I had disengaged
      him, and put him back into the water, he simply gave a flip of his little
      tail, and sailed contemptuously and quite leisurely out of sight, making
      me call to mind, with unusual humiliation, the well-known definition which
      Dr. Johnson gave of angling&mdash;"a fish at one end of the line, and a
      fool at the other," I had tried a good many, casts before I took my first
      respectable fish&mdash;a trout of about half a pound. I caught him in a
      nice broken bit of water, just below a quaint old water-mill; and just as
      I put him into the basket, the portly miller came out to the granary door,
      and looked at me with a dusty smile. He evidently thought me a lunatic, to
      be out with a fishing-rod on such a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a mile further on I landed another glittering picture of at least a
      quarter of a pound; after that, another of half a pound; then my luck
      ceased, the wind fell, and it was full sunshine. By this time I had
      wandered a good many miles from home, and reached the spot where the river
      plunges into the Great Omberley woods. Here the stream was so rapid and
      the boughs so thick, that it was useless to think of casting; so I put up
      my rod, and, leaping over a fence, rambled away into the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      How strange and dark and still it was, passing out of the sunshine into
      those shadows, deep and cool as the bottom of the sea! The oak trees
      stretched their gnarled boughs into the air, and all around them were the
      lesser trees of the wood-willow, elder, blackthorn, ash, and hazel. The
      ground beneath was carpeted with moss and grass as thick and soft as
      velvet, with thick clusters of fern and bluebells round the tree roots,
      and creepers dangling from every bough. And the wood, like the river, was
      all alive! Conies tumbled across the patches of light, and flitted in the
      shadow, like very elves of the woodland; squirrels ran up the gnarled tree
      trunks; harmless silver snakes glided along the moss; but here and there,
      swift and ominous, ran a weazel, darting its head this way and that, and
      fiercely scenting the air, in one eternal glitter and hurry of
      bloodthirsty emotion. Thrush, blackbird, finch, birds without number, sang
      overhead; save when the shadow of the wind-hover or the sparrow-hawk
      passed across the topmost branches, when there was a sudden and respectful
      silence, to be followed by a precipitate hurry of exultation, as the enemy
      passed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had been a moralist, I might have seen in this wood a microcosm of
      the world, with its abundant happiness, its beauty, and its dark spots of
      moral ugliness and cruelty. In you, Signor Weazel (who came so near that I
      touched you with my rod, which you snapped at ferociously, before bolting
      swiftly into the deep grass), I might have seen the likeness of a certain
      sleek creature of my own sex and species, who dwells not very far away.
      Nevertheless, I let you go in peace; which was no mercy to the conies, I
      suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I entered the Forest Primaeval&mdash;or such it seemed to me, as the
      blaze of sunshine faded, the boughs thickened, the air became full of dark
      shadows and ominous silence. My steps were now deep in grass and fern, and
      the scent of flowers and weeds was thick in my nostrils, but I chose a
      path where the boughs were thinnest, and quietly pushed through. While
      thus I rambled, I suppose that I fell, philosopher like, into a dream; at
      any rate, I seemed to lose all count of time.=
    </p>
    <p>
      ```"The world, the life of men, dissolved away
    </p>
    <p>
      ```Into a sense of dimness,"=
    </p>
    <p>
      as some poet sings. I felt primaeval&mdash;archetypal so to speak, till a
      sudden' shifting of the vegetable kaleidoscope recalled from thoughts of
      Plato and the Archetype to a cruel consciousness of self.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was moving slowly on, when I heard the sound of voices quite close to
      me. I paused, listening, and only just in time, for in another moment I
      should have been visible to the speakers. Well shrouded in deep foliage, I
      looked out to discover what sylvan creatures were disporting themselves in
      that lonely place; and I saw&mdash;what shall I say? A nymph and a satyr?
      a dryad and a goatfooted Faun?
    </p>
    <p>
      Just beyond me, there was a broad-green road through the woodland, deeply
      carpeted with soft grass, but marked here and there with the broad track
      of a wood-waggon; and on the side of this solitary road, on a rude seat
      fashioned of two oaken stumps and a rough plank, the nymph was sitting.
      She wore a light dress of some soft material, a straw hat, a country
      cloak, and gloves of Paris kid&mdash;a civilized nymph, as you perceive!
      To complete her modern appearance, she carried a closed parasol, and a
      roll which looked like music.
    </p>
    <p>
      How pretty she looked, with the warm light playing upon her delicate
      features, and suffusing her form in its delicate drapery; with the
      semi-transparent branches behind her, and flowers of the woodland at her
      feet!

      CHAPTER XXVII. THE NOTE-BOOK CONTINUED NYMPH AND SATYR.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd the satyr? Ah!
      I knew him at a glance, despite the elegant modern boots used to disguise
      the cloven foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wore black broadcloth and snowy linen, too, and a broad-brimmed
      clerical hat. His face was seraphically pale, but I saw (or fancied I saw)
      the twinkle of the hairy ears of the ignoble, sensual, nymph-compelling,
      naiad-pursuing breed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was talking earnestly, with gestures of eager entreaty; for the nymph
      was crying, and he was offering her some kind of consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he sat down by her side, and threw his arms around her. She
      disengaged herself from his embrace, and rose trembling to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't touch me!" she cried. "That is all over now. I cannot bear it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose also, and stood regarding her, not with the rapturous eyes' of a
      lover, but with a dark and gloomy gaze. Then he said, in a low voice,
      something which I could not catch. But I heard her passionate reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is all over," she cried; "and I shall never be at peace again.
      Even, if you kept your word, it would be the same. You do not love me; you
      never loved me&mdash;never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I crept a little closer, for I was anxious to hear his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do love you, Edith; and after what has passed between us&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrank away with a faint, despairing cry, and put her hand to her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After what has passed between us, do you think that my love can change?
      But you are unjust to me, to yourself; too violent and too hard to please.
      I do not like to be suspected, to be watched; and it is painful to me,
      very painful, to be constantly called to an account by you. It is not
      reasonable. Even as your husband, I would not bear it; it would poison the
      peace between us, and convert our married life into a simple hell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused; but her only answer was a sob of pain. So he sermonized on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Between man and woman, Edith, there should be solemn confidence and
      trust. When that ceases, love is sure to cease. Why, look at me! My trust
      in you is so absolute that no action of yours could shake it; no matter
      how peculiar were the circumstances, I should be certain of your faith,
      your goodness. That is true love&mdash;absolute, implicit faith in the
      beloved object. I wish I could persuade you to imitate it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that you can trust me," sobbed the poor child, "because I have:
      <i>proved</i> my love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I not proved mine?" he cried, with irritation. "Have I not made
      sacrifice upon sacrifice for your sake? Have I not remained here, in this
      wretched country place, when I could have been promoted to other and
      greater spheres of action? Have I not made you my companion, my
      confidante, my nearest and dearest friend? Edith, why do you persist in
      such accusations? What must I do to signify our attachment? Shall I marry
      you at once? Speak the word, and although, as you know, it would involve
      the ruin of all my worldly projects, I will do as you desire."
    </p>
    <p>
      I had-heard enough to convince me that the affair under discussion was no
      affair of mine, and that I had no right to continue playing the spy; so I
      was drawing back as gently as possible, and about to return the way I
      came, when I was suddenly arrested by the next words spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give up Mrs. Haldane!"
    </p>
    <p>
      I The nymph was the speaker. She stood with her wild eyes fixed upon the
      other's face, which did not improve in beauty of expression. For myself, I
      started, stung to the quick; then I returned, trembling, to my place of
      espionage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give up Mrs. Haldane!" repeated the girl. "I ask nothing more than that.
      I will not force you to marry me, Charles, till it is for your good;
      indeed, if I did, I know that we should be unhappy, and that you would
      never forgive me. But you can at least cease to be so familiar with Mrs.
      Haldane."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had discovered by this time, I suppose, that the pleading mood availed
      him little; at all events, he suddenly changed his tone, and with a cry of
      angry indignation, he exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edith, take care! I have told you that I will not suffer it! How dare you
      suspect that lady! How dare you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he stood towering over her (the satyr!) in the fulness of his snowy
      shirtfront and the whiteness of his moral indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no use being angry," she returned, with a certain stubbornness,
      though I could see that she was cowed, in the manner of gentle women, by
      his violent physical passion. "After what you have told me, after what I
      have seen&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edith, again, take care!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are always with her," she continued, "night-time and day-time. I am
      amazed that Mr. Haldane does not notice it. It is the talk of the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      With another exclamation, he turned his back and walked rapidly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come back!" she cried hysterically. "If you leave like that, I will drown
      myself in the river."
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned and faced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will drive me mad!" he said. "I am sick of it. I am more like a slave
      than a free man. You will not suffer me even to have a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is more than a friend. You have told me yourself, that you loved
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so I did," he answered, "though of course she is nothing to me <i>now</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you always with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am interested in her, deeply interested. She is unhappy with her
      husband, and as a minister of the gospel&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      With her tearful, truthful eyes, fixed so earnestly upon him, no wonder he
      paused and blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles, do not be a hypocrite! At least be honest. She is more to you
      than a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hands heavenward, in pulpit fashion, and protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edith, I swear to you before God, that there is nothing whatever between
      us. She is a stainless lady, her husband does not understand her, I am her
      spiritual friend and guide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Charles; I understand," she said, still earnestly watching him. "<i>Justus
      you were mine!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it worth while to put that little sentence in italics. It was a
      home stroke, and took away the satyr's breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edith, for shame!" he cried. "You know you do not mean what you say. If I
      thought you meant it, I should break with you for ever. I tell you again,
      Mrs. Haldane is above reproach, and it is simply disgraceful to couple her
      name, in such a manner, with mine. And you would infer, now, that I have
      influenced your own life for evil; you would mock at my spiritual
      pretensions, and brand me as a base, unworthy creature. Well, Edith,
      perhaps you are right. Perhaps I have given you cause. I have shown you
      that I love you, beyond position, beyond the world, beyond even my own
      self-respect, and this is my return."
    </p>
    <p>
      I could have sprung out and strangled the fellow, he was so cruel and yet
      so plausible, so superbly selfish and yet so completely self-deceiving;
      and I saw that with every word he uttered he gained a fresh hold over the
      heart of the pretty fool who was listening. While he spoke, she sobbed as
      if her little heart was ready to break; and when he ceased, she eagerly
      held out her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Charles, don't say that! Don't say that my love has been a curse to
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You drive me to say it," he answered moodily; "you make me miserable with
      your jealousy, your suspicion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say that I make you miserable&mdash;don't!" she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You used to be so different," he continued, still preserving his tone of
      moral injury; "you used to be so interested in my work, my daily duties.
      Now, you do nothing but reproach me; and why? Because I have found an old
      friend, who happens to be of your own sex, but who is far above the folly
      of a meaningless flirtation, and who little deserves the cruel slur you
      cast upon her. Am I, then, to have no friends, no acquaintances? Is every
      step I take to be measured by the unreasoning suspicion of a jealous
      woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time she had put her arms about his neck, and was sobbing on his
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Charles, don't be so hard with me! It is all because I love you&mdash;ah,
      so much!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you should conquer these wicked feelings&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I try! I try!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should have more confidence, more faith. You know how much I care for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but sometimes I feel afraid. Mrs. Haldane is so much cleverer, so
      much more beautiful, than I am, and she was your first love. They say men
      never love twice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is nonsense, Edith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you do love me, dear? you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ugh, the satyr! He answered her with kisses, straining her to his heart
      and she, sobbing and clinging round him, was quite conquered. I felt sick
      to see her at his mercy. Then their voices sank, and he whispered, and I
      saw the bright blood mount to her cheek and brow. But, alas! she did not
      shrink away any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then whispering and kissing, with eyes of passion fixed upon one another,
      they moved away, taking a lonely path into the woods beyond me. My first
      impulse was to follow them, and to tear them asunder. But after all, I
      reflected it was no affair of mine, and I knew now, moreover, that nothing
      in the world would save her from him&mdash;or from herself. .

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
